    <h1>Henri Bergius</h1>

    <p>Henri Bergius, a.k.a. Bergie, is a former Viking originally from the Nordic country of Finland but living in Berlin. When he is not exploring Georgiaâ€™s cave cities or running with the bulls in Pamplona, Bergie works on web services built on top of the Midgard toolkit. His company, Nemein, provides web and mobile solutions for several major companies in Finland and abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
After half a decade of regular web development, Bergie got involved with free software in 1999 by coordinating the public release of the Midgard content management system. Since then, he has been actively working on integrating standards like RDFa into the system and traveling the world advocating interoperation between open-source CMSs.
