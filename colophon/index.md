[This site]({{ base }}/) is the personal blog of [Henri Bergius]({{ base }}/about/). It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. I write my articles in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and commit them to [GitHub](https://github.com/), which triggers [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to produce the pages you're viewing.

## Design and visuals

The header photo used on this site was taken by [Jeff Woods](https://www.jeffreyandjuliawoods.com/).

My mugshot is a wetplate photo taken by [Oleg Farynyuk](https://www.slow-photography-berlin.com/).

The line drawing of me was produced by [Nina Mutik](http://ninamutik.sarjakuvablogit.com/about/), a Finnish artist.

The flying pig emblem has been drawn by [Susanna Huhtanen](http://cannonerd.wordpress.com/) based on a medieval pilgrim's badge. After all, _a pig that doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig_.

The web design is my own.

## Writing and storing content

Since the content is handled as Markdown files in a Git repository, I'm mostly writing them using [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) on an iPad Pro.

Before June 2012 this blog ran on top of the [MidCOM](http://midgard-project.org/midcom) PHP framework and the posts of that time were produced using it and stored to [Midgard1](http://midgard-project.org/midgard1/). All the old Midgard contents have been converted to the Jekyll format using a simple [NoFlo](https://noflojs.org/) program.

Some of the older posts have also been migrated from my other websites, like [Qaiku](http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.qaiku.com/home/bergie/) and [Tumblr](http://universalruntime.tumblr.com/). Thanks to [Wayback Machine](http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://bergie.greywolves.org/) I was able to also import a lot of my earlier posts from 1997 to 2004.

## Semantics

An [RSS feed]({{ base }}/blog/rss.xml) of the latest blog contents is available. In addition, the HTML pages are made machine-readable through [RDFa annotations](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/), in this case following the [schema.org](http://schema.org/) vocabularies.

## Syndication

Various sites syndicate either my whole blog or parts of it. These include:

* [Planet FSFe](http://planet.fsfe.org/)
* [Planet GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org/)
* [Planet KDE](http://planetkde.org/)
