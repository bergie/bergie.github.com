I'm currently in _Berlin, Germany_. Here are the things I'm working on. You can see some of these in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/bergie):

* Coordinating various development projects and building the back-end of [The Grid](https://thegrid.io/)
* Exploring the world of [Interplanetary Filesystems](https://ipfs.io/)
* Preparing for the [German sailing license](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportbootf%C3%BChrerschein_Binnen) exam
* Trying to publish daily at my linklog, [Bergie Today](http://bergie.today/)
* Porting the contents of this site to The Grid
