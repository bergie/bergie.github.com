Here are some things I'm doing currently:

* Coordinating various development projects and building the back-end of [The Grid](https://thegrid.io/)
* Exploring the world of [Interplanetary Filesystems](https://ipfs.io/)
* Preparing for the [German sailing license](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportbootf%C3%BChrerschein_Binnen) exam
* Rebuilding my personal and business accounting with [Ledger](http://www.ledger-cli.org/)
* Trying to publish daily at my linklog, [Bergie Today](http://bergie.today/)
* Porting the contents of this site to The Grid

This status page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
