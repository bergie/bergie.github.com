    I've been running this website since 1997, and many things have changed then. This includes the web platform, moving from custom Perl scripts in late 90s to various versions of <a href="http://midgard-project.org">Midgard</a>, and finally to the <a href="/colophon/">current setup</a>. This makes it difficult to ensure that all pages have retained their URLs.
