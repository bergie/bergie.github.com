  <h2>Sailing</h2>
  <p>I've been into sailing from an early age, having started with cruising on my grandparents' boat. In the early 2000s I spent couple of summers on <a href="/blog/2005-06-27-1119894307/">reconstructed viking ships</a>, and in 2014 I <a href="/blog/sailing-across-the-atlantic/">sailed across the Atlantic</a> on a sail training schooner.</p>
  <p>Since 2018 I've been part of a boat crew in Berlin, maintaining and sailing with <em>S/Y Curiosity</em>, where I also build various <a href="/blog/signalk-boat-iot/">marine electronics systems</a>.</p>
