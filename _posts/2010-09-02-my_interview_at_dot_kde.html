<p><a href="http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/">Jos Poortvliet</a> did <a href="http://dot.kde.org/2010/07/23/henri-bergius-akademy-midgard-open-collaboration-services-and-geoclue">an interview with me for dot KDE</a> in this summer's aKademy and it has been online for a while now. In it we discuss things like <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/ratatoskr_is_out-midgard2_content_repository_goes_lts/">Midgard as a storage engine</a> for desktop applications, and <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras-testing#Community_Quality_Assurance">Maemo's open QA process</a> for <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/Maemo5/">Downloads</a> applications. Some excepts:</p>
<blockquote>At <a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo.org</a> we have an appstore for  FOSS applications on the Maemo platform. This appstore is enabled by  default on all Nokia N900s so we wanted to have some quality control. We  had to create our own appstore approval process, compatible with the  FOSS philosophy. Now any developer can submit an app, and anyone can  test and vote. The whole process is completely transparent, auditable  and visible. And it also provides a feedback channel from testers and  users to the developers!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Midgard is a data storage service. Whether you write desktop or web  applications, instead of coming up with your own file format, you just  use Midgard. You can work more easily and object-based. Users have many  different devices these days, so Midgard has strong replication features  to synchronize between different systems. Midgard is built on top of  GObject; we provide bindings to a bunch of different languages so  developers can choose the tools they like - PHP, Python, Javascript.  Currently (as in <strong>now</strong>, while we're talking) Qt bindings are being developed here at Akademy.</blockquote>
