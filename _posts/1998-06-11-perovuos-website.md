A layout given to a friend.

This was intresting. I had now a chance to experience doing charity work, in the form of donating some of my old web design sketches for a friend of mine.

Main thing was giving my old plan for Bergie.Net to Juha Perovuo, a fellow commune-dweller, to function as his homepage. A quite nice design, I would say, altough not maybe suiting the quality demands I have for my own homepage.

So there it is, on web, at <http://www.greywolves.org/~waltari>. Go check it out, and if interested in his cause, drop him a word.

But to cut this short, I'm going to sleep again...
