<a href="http://www.nemein.com/people/rambo/">Eero</a> has been working on <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/openpsa/sales.html">OpenPSA Sales</a> lately to support the <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> deployment <a href="http://www.helia.fi/en/">Helsinki Business Polytechnic</a> (Helia) is now doing.
</p>

<p>
Helia will be using OpenPSA for managing all their corporate connections, including students' work orientation periods and their service sales.
</p>

<p>
However, some of the screens in Sales have been left with quite an <em>industrial</em> look by Eero. One of the worst was the campaign query tool, which is used for searching contacts to be included to a campaign (mass mailing, event registration etc). This query form was quite hideous to begin with, but with addition of some new fields it simply didn't scale.
</p>

<p>
I've now reorganized it for better clarity:

</p>

<p>
Previously the query fields were organized quite randomly, but now
they're in four separate groups:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Area selectors (country, post codes)</li>
  <li>Company type selectors (business area, number of employees)</li>
  <li>Connection type selectors (products offered to them, sales project statuses)</li>
  <li>Result criteria (sorting etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, the screen now allows direct creation of new campaigns.
