<p>There was a pretty interesting snippet in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/14/live-from-nokia-world-2010/?sort=newest&amp;refresh=60">Engadget's coverage</a> of yesterday's <a href="http://events.nokia.com/nokiaworld/home.htm">Nokia World</a> keynote:</p>
<blockquote>"By 2013 800 million people will be using GPS-enabled devices. Soon,  everything on the Internet will have a location coordinate. This is a  space we intend to own."</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, this is a quite possible future, and one for which we with Midgard are quite well prepared for. Many smartphone browsers (and even desktops) nowadays can <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/browser_geolocation_without_gps-quite_accurate_enough/">transmit their location</a> to web services, more and more geotagged information is being published via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_%28microformat%29">microformats</a>, <a href="http://www.georss.org/Main_Page">feeds</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/">RDF</a>. From the humble beginnings with <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/plazecamp/">Plazes</a>, social web services like <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/06/twitter-places-more-context-for-your.html">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/go/4pje/">Qaiku</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/places/">Facebook</a> can now store and display location where different status updates were made.</p>
<p>The missing piece for a wider-scale geotagged web however is actual usage of geodata. We need <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/position_editing_widget_for_midgard/">easy tools for tagging content</a> with locations, but also web services that actually serve their users better thanks to location information. This can mean helping the user to <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/buscatcher-never_miss_another_tram/">catch a bus</a>, or <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/halti-com_provides_contextual_product_recommendations/">recommending them clothes</a> purchases based on local weather. Anything that goes beyond just showing dots on a map.</p>
<p>For that, Midgard has had the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/the-midgard-position/">necessary infrastructure</a> in place. What we need is your ideas and use cases for how to improve web services through location.</p>
