<p>This weekend, after <a href="http://falsyvalues.com/">Falsy Values</a>, I will be flying to San Francisco for a couple of weeks. There are some conferences:</p>
<p>
</p><ul><li><a href="http://sf2011.meego.com/">MeeGo Conference</a>, May 23-25</li>
<li><a href="http://aloha-editor.org/wiki/Aloha_Editor_Dev_Con_SanFrancisco_11">Aloha Editor dev con</a>, June 6-8</li>
</ul><div>However, as there is quite some time between these two events, it would be interesting to meet cool people and/or projects. So if you're in the area, drop <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/">me</a> a note.</div>
