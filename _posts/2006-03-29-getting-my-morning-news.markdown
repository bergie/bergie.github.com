In order to make my news-reading process less time consuming, I've now switched from [NetNewsWire][1] running all the time on my PowerBook to the [Bloglines][2] web service primarily used through my [Nokia 770][3] handheld browser.

Why use Bloglines? There are some good reasons:

1. Bloglines centralizes RSS feed fetching, making news reading less bandwidth-intensive
2. It centralizes information of what items I have read, meaning that I see only unread things whether I use my Mac, my 770, or some other computer at a client
3. their [subscription sharing][4] system enables me to easily back up my subscription list as [OPML][5]. Even if Bloglines shut their service tomorrow, only thing I would lose would be information on which items I've read and which not

If the news items contain something interesting I will want to return to later or blog about, I can bookmark it using my [del.icio.us account][6]. The del.icio.us bookmarks used to be synchronized with my [own site][7], but this isn't operational at the moment.

## Making things work even better

In ideal world I would be able to do most of this offline. I would connect my 770 to the net before leaving home and synchronize the news there. Then I could read the news in bus or over breakfast, and bookmark the interesting items.

There is an [offline Bloglines client][8] for Nokia 770, but it is still at quite early staging and crashes quite often. 

Similarly, there is a quite nice [del.icio.us client][9], but as far as I know it doesn't support saving bookmarks while offline.

If these two issues would be resolved, I would have a quite perfect news-reading and research setup.
