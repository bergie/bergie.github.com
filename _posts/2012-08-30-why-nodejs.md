## Why another JavaScript syntax?

JavaScript the environment and JavaScript the syntax are two completely different things. Under the misleadingly Java-like surface lies something inspired by the most powerful and flexible languages out there.

Folklore has it that JavaScript creator Brendan Eich had something like Lisp in mind. But then corporate politics kicked in, and Netscape's then-partner Sun Microsystems mandated the syntax we now know. Netscape's LiveScript became JavaScript in order to build hype for the up-and-coming Java ecosystem.

Because of this the JavaScript syntax may not be the best way to write something for JavaScript the environment.

## About this book

The story of this book begins in Warsaw, Poland. I was attending the Falsy Values JavaScript conference, and Tom Hughes-Croucher, the author of O'Reilly's Up and runnign with Node.js was giving a tutorial there. By that time I was already quite familiar with the environment, and so busied myself with porting his excercises to CoffeeScript. I published them as a public Gist which received quite a bit of attention, ending up to sites like Hacker News and Web Worker Daily.

The visibility for my CoffeeScript was pleasant, but I expected this to be the end of it. Later in the same summer I was working on a project in Salzburg, Austria, while I received an enquiry from O'Reilly on whether I'd be interested in writing a book on the subject. After some pondering, and lots of gentle goading from Susanna Huhtanen, I agreed. I've been an active Open Source contributor for more than a decate, and many have seen pieces of my code, or my blogs. Now it was time to scale up, and wrap things up in a more scalable and reusable format.

Then of course life intervened. Nemein, the Finnish software consulting company I had co-founded back in 2001, merged with another company. I moved from Helsinki to Berlin in order to be closer to our customers. All of this ensured that the progress on the book was slow in the first six-or-so months. And of course there were the actual Node.js software projects I had to work on for our clients. After many false starts and faltered attempts I did what any self-respecting 19th Century author would do and took an extended writing retreat in Istanbul.

This proved to be the right choice. Not only the delay gave me the time necessary to gain more experience with Node.js in real-world deployments. This will hopefully show in the book, allowing readers to skip many of the mistakes I made in the early stages of working with this young ecosystem. Also, Istanbul is an amazing place if you want to focus on something big. Inspiring surroundings, and cafes where the uninterrupted supply of tea and waterpipe coal give provide an author with an inspiring environment. Thanks to it, the bulk of this book came into being in the terraces of places like Tophane and Sultanahmet, where a weary author would only need to lift his head to rest and gaze on Medieval architecture or ships passing by on the Bosphorus.

The flurry of exotic locations in the preceding paragraphs may also serve as a testament to the mobility of a modern hacker-nomad. Wherever electricity and WiFi is available is a potential place to work, so why not in a place that truly inspires you?
