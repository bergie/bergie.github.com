The <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Algorithm">geohashing algorithm</a> uses the current date and the day's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> to generate a new location for each <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Graticule">region</a> in the world. Geohashers then use <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Achievements#Getting_There">various means</a> to <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Expedition">reach that location</a> in search for fun and adventure.

As out there was beautiful autumn weather, and I needed to go somewhere to air my thoughts, I decided to hunt down today's geohash of the <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Helsinki%2C_Finland">Helsinki region</a>. To do so, I fired up the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284951057&amp;mt=8.">Geohashing iPhone application</a>, and let it count me the coordinates. As it happens, <a href="http://irc.peeron.com/xkcd/map/map.html?date=2008-09-27&amp;lat=60&amp;long=24&amp;zoom=8">the spot</a> was in the end of a gravel forest road between Renko and HÃ¤meenlinna.

Calculating the route with <a href="http://www.mcwetboy.net/maproom/2007/01/iphone_includes.php">iPhone's map software</a> to be 108km, I put on some warmer clothes and jumped on <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/royal_enfield-built_like_a_gun.html">my bike</a>, heading leisurely north on smaller side roads. I had a lunch stop at <a href="http://www.ravintolakeskus.fi/ravintolat/Rajam%E4ki/Kahvila+Roosa/3975">Roosa</a>, and then made my way to the destination.

The <a href="http://www.visitfinland.com/w5/index.nsf/(pages)/Hunting">moose hunting</a> season has just started and some gunshots could be heard in the woods. This worried me a bit, especially as the road's sign had some bullet holes, but the locals I passed on the gravel roads seemed friendly enough.

While Google Maps didn't show it, the spot was actually easier to reach, as it was just some ten meters from a small gravel road. I took the necessary <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Achievements#Proof">picture proof</a>, had a chocolate bar, and then headed back.
</p><p>
This was <a href="http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/2008-09-27_60_24">my first geohash</a>. Definitely a fun way to experience your surroundings spiced up with some randomness!
