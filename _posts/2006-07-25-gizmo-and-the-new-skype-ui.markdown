While I [appreciate][1] the fact that [Gizmo][2] uses [open standards][3] for internet telephony, and that it is available for my [Nokia 770][4], it still has to be mentioned that [its user interface][5] has a lot to learn from the [latest Skype beta][6]. You just have to love the simple, purpose-driven UI:

Hopefully an updated [Adium plugin][7] would bring similar simplicity for Gizmo. 

In the meanwhile, I could wonder why the VoIP vendors want to stick [instant messaging][8] into their applications. Most people already have an IM client they use, and while the one in Gizmo at least is [standard Jabber client][9], I would still prefer to use my own servers and Jabber IDs instead.

__Updated 2006-07-26:__ ThoughtFix has a [quite favorable Gizmo-on-770 review][10]. Sounds promising.
