It has to be said that <a href="http://www.best-off.org/">Daniel's team</a> has made amazing progress with the administrative interface. The new UI looks very slick, and <a href="http://www.tonio.com/">Tony Lee's</a> logo design fits it very well.<br /><br />The user interface is also using our NemeinLocalization library. As soon as the language strings are included in the build I will translate them to Finnish.<br /><br />In addition to translations, the first glitches we've noticed have been the <span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;This is the place where we will put a DocBook created HTML documentation for
SpiderAdmin&quot;</span> message and some oddities with move commands.<br /><br />All in all, very good work! I'll keep this updated on how our &quot;living without <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/aegir/">Aegir</a>&quot; project with OpenPSA development goes.<br /><br />A cool little factoid that the original project name &quot;Odin&quot; is still kept in use in SpiderAdmin internals. Very Midgard-like :-)<br />
