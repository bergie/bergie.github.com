> As I [previously][4] noted, thanks to a generous sponsorship from [Business Objects][2] and the [Eclipse Foundation][3], there will be an Open Source Pavilion at [EclipseCon][5] this year. Ten pods have been set aside to celebrate projects that exeplify the F/OSS community that represents the spirit of EclipseCon. It's a great example of an ecosystem in action.

Midgard [is one of these][6]. My session proposal can be found from [EclipseZilla][7], the conference's Bugzilla-based program manager.

While I will be focusing on regular [Midgard][11] and [MidCOM][12] in the session, we have been talking with [Jukka][8] about trying to get [Day's Eclipse plugin][9] to work with [Midgard-Java][10] before the event.

__Updated 2006-02-18:__ [The proposal][13] was accepted:

> We are happy to accept your Demos proposal - "Midgard CMS" - for EclipseCon 2006.  Within a month or so, you will receive a Speaker Agreement from us
  outlining all the deadlines, audio-visual, permission forms, etc.  Until
  then, your only task is to celebrate this acceptance with your favorite beverage.
