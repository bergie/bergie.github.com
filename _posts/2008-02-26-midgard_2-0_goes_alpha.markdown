[This](http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/view/1204025654.html) is a historical moment:

<blockquote>The first alpha of the Midgard 2.0 branch is targeted at web framework
and desktop developers. This release does not consist of the CMS
components, but instead targets at providing the development tools for
building a modern web framework. Framework based not only on one tool,
but which can connect multiple technologies and languages.<br /><br />
The version 3 of MidCOM web content management components for PHP5 are
currently in the process of being ported to the Midgard 2.0 platform.</blockquote>

Good work, [Piotras](http://blogs.nemein.com/people/piotras/) and [the team](http://www.midgard-project.org/community/whoswho/)!
