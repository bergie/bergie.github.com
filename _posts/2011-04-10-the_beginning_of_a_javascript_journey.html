<p>While PHP remains my primary programming language for <a href="http://blog.liip.ch/archive/2011/02/24/why-we-stick-to-php.html">various reasons</a>, my recent projects have involved quite a bit <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/vie_decoupled_content_management_moves_forward/">of JavaScript development</a>. And I have to say I like it: the event-driven paradigm is quite elegant, closures are a joy to work with, and tools like <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> really open up the possibilities of the language.</p>
<p>But there is one weakness in the JS ecosystem: as things are just now picking up, the amount of information on especially making larger applications is quite sparse. To help solving this issue, I decided to start a new blog dedicated to what I learn in that space.</p>
<p>Like my <a href="http://universalruntime.tumblr.com/post/4340045330/universalruntime">earlier piece</a> on the importance of the language, the blog is called <a href="http://universalruntime.tumblr.com/"><strong>The Universal Runtime</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you run into interesting tutorials on JavaScript, or are doing something cool in the space, let me know!</p>
