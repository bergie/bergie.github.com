<blockquote>&quot;The current <a href="http://www.fairvue.com/?feature=awards2004">excitement</a> over 
blogs is curious, since they amount to little more than personal Web pages.  Although a 
standard <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html">history</a> of blogging dates the phenomenon to 1997, the key attributes of the blog - a 
page of selected links and comments in reverse chronological order - can be found as far 
back as <a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-0693.html">June 1993</a> on the NCSA What's New <a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/whats-new.html">site</a>, one 
of the most popular destinations of the nascent Web world.&quot;</blockquote>
