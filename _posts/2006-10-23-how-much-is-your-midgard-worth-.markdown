Inspired by the [PHP Eats Rails for Breakfast][1] report, I've registered [Midgard CMS][2] at [Ohloh][3], a service tracking code contributions in various free software projects.

Even though it only covers the [post-filesystem transition][5] MidCOM and not whole Midgard, __[the Midgard Ohloh report][4]__ has interesting things to tell:

* Codebase: 235,264 lines of code
* Estimated effort to produce: 62 man years
* Cost to produce: 3,4 million USD
* Programming languages:
  - PHP: 61%
  - Javascript: 27%
  - HTML: 10%

We'll have to see how the numbers change once I add the main Midgard repository with its accumulated history since 1999.

[Tobias Schlitt][6] has more detailed analysis of a MidCOM competitor, [eZ components on Ohloh][7].
