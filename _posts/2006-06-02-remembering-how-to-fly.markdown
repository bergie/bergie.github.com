Kerttu had her entry exams to the <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/bio/english/">Biological faculty</a> of University of Helsinki yesterday, and therefore she is now free to enjoy the summer.<br />
<br />
To mark that, we decided to go flying a bit around Espoo and Porvoo. The runway 27 was in use so we took the plane out through Nokka and returned later through Deger.<br />
<br />
The wind was a bit bumpy, but otherwise it was nice to fly again after the long winter break, made even longer by my trips to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/sets/72157594145039266/">US</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/sets/72157594144913040/">Brazil</a>.<br />
