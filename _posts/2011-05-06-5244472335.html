title: Make the web editable
---

<p><a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/the-road-to-html-5-contenteditable">contentEditable</a> is the HTML5 feature that enables rich text editing on web pages. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb">original web browser</a> that Tim Berners-Lee created was also a web editor, and contentEditable brings <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm">this possibility</a> to all browsers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The idea was that anybody who used the web would have a space where they could write and so the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader. Every person who used the web had the ability to write something. It was very easy to make a new web page and comment on what somebody else had written, which is very much what blogging is about.</p>

<p>There are some great rich text editors built on top of contentEditable, the open source <a href="http://aloha-editor.org/">Aloha Editor</a> being my personal favorite.</p>

<p>But in some situations you&#8217;ll want a different user experience than this CMS-oriented tool. For those situations, here is a list of resources about rolling your own web editors:</p>

</ul><p>I&#8217;m using these resources in building <a href="https://github.com/bergie/hallo">Hallo</a>, a simplistic rich text editor written in CoffeeScript on top of jQuery UI.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: unfortunately some popular mobile platforms like iOS <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/723592/why-doesnt-contenteditable-work-on-the-iphone">do not support contentEditable</a> correctly. If you need to support mobile editing, then the <a href="https://github.com/dnewcome/richie">Richie editor</a> might be of interest.</p>
