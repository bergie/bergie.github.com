The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_leaf_color">"ruska season"</a> has now started and so we decided to go hiking in the <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=5510">Evo area</a> last weekend.

Pretty nice trip of walking in the woods and enjoying songs, pipe and whisky at fireside. We slept the first night in tent and the second in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean-to#Laavu">laavu</a>:

Weather was a bit rainy on Saturday, but with good gear this was not much of a problem. More <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/sets/72157602045266843/">pictures on Flickr</a>.
