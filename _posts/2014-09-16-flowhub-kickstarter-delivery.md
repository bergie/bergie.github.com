It is now a year since our [NoFlo Development Environment](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment) Kickstarter got funded. Since then our team together with several open source contributors has been busy building the best possible user interface for Flow-Based Programming.

When we set out on this crazy adventure, we still mostly had only [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/) and JavaScript in mind. But there is nothing inherently language-specific in FBP or our UI, and so when people started making other runtimes compatible with [the protocol](http://noflojs.org/documentation/protocol/) we embraced the idea of [full-stack flow-based programming](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/full-stack-fbp/).

Here is how the runtime registration screen looks with [the latest release](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment/posts/985898):

This hopefully highlights a bit of the possibilities of what can be done with [Flowhub](http://flowhub.io/) right now. I know there are several other runtimes that are not yet listed there. We should have something interesting to announce in that space soon!

## Live mode

The Flowhub release made today includes several interesting features apart from giving *private repository access* to our [Kickstarter backers](http://noflojs.org/kickstarter/). One I'm especially happy about is what we call *live mode*.

The live mode, initially built by [Lionel Landwerlin](https://github.com/djdeath), enables Flowhub to discover and connect to running pieces of Flow-Based software running in different environments. With it you can monitor, debug, and modify applications without having to restart them!

We made a [short demo video](http://youtu.be/EdgeSDFd9p0) of this in action with Flowhub, Raspberry Pi and an NFC tag.

## Getting started

Our backers should receive an email today with instructions on how to activate their Flowhub plans. For those who missed the Kickstarter, there should be another batch of [Flowhub pre-orders](http://flowhub.io/preorder/) available soon.

Just like with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), Flowhub is free for open source development. So, everybody should be able to [start using it](http://flowhub.io/#app-scope) immediately even without a plan.

If you have any questions about Flow-Based Programming or how to use Flowhub, please check out the various ways to get in touch on the [NoFlo support page](http://noflojs.org/support/).
