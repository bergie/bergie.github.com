<p>
<strong>MgdSchema</strong> is the new way for defining Midgard's object types in XML being worked on by Piotras. So, why are <a href="http://www.nemein.com/">we</a> sponsoring this development? Here are some blue-sky points brainstormed in our hostel during the first evening of the Link√∂ping gathering:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>List optimization</strong> gives ability to tune SQL queries with custom limiters for faster lists</li>
  <li><strong>Extension</strong> of Midgard objects with arbitrary fields without current parameter-induced performance loss is possible</li>
  <li>Inheritable <strong>access control</strong> of both read and write permissions can be set for groups on per-object level</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus items:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maintainability</strong> of the C code is better without having to maintain separate function sets for each object type</li>
  <li><strong>Scriptability</strong> of the new GObjects and Gnome-DB based core provides Midgard connectivity to programming languages like Python and Ruby</li>
  <li>Bringing <strong>GNOME</strong> technologies to the server links Midgard more closely with an active community</li>
  <li>Standard <strong>metadata</strong> is available for all MidgardObjects including creator, revisor and locking</li>
  <li><strong>Database independence</strong> provided by Gnome-DB enables administrators to set up Midgard with any database they want</li>
</ul>

<p>
So far these are only ideas but hopefully today's meeting will give more form for them.
