This trip will be headed to the Black Sea, and possibly to the Caucasus region. Research for the Caucasus part of the trip <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004/2004-06-08-001.html">has been going on</a> for quite a while, but now it looks like the area might be a bit too restless for travel.
</p>

<p>
Today I've been busy getting some tools and other gear in order, and fixing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050922212558/http://www.routamc.org/updates/2004-06-30-000.html">Jose's Royal Enfield</a>. Tomorrow I will fetch my visas from Lähialuematkat, and start packing.
</p>

<p>
If everything goes well, the trip will start on Saturday morning when we ride to St. Petersburg.
</p>

<p>
I've looked at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050922212558/http://www.routamc.org/gallery/russia-2003/IMG_3007.html">packing list</a> from last summer's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050922212558/http://www.routamc.org/journal/Russian%20motorcycle%20tour%202003/">Russian motorcycle tour</a>, and there will be some modifications:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>This time I will not carry a PDA as I can write journal entries via SMS</li>
  <li>There will be more tools as I'm traveling alone</li>
  <li>I will bring some maps and dictionaries to make the trip easier</li>
  <li>As my GPS is dead I will use a tank-mounted map bag for navigation</li>
  <li>I'm still torn on whether to bring camping equipment or not. Last year they were practically unused as accommodation is cheap in Russia</li>
</ul>

<p>
I will post the full packing list when I have the gear sorted out.
</p><p>
The SMS journal writing system should be rigged now. Expect frequent updates once the trip has begun. Now it is tandoori time :-)

The trip is really shaping up. Russian and Ukrainian visas are in my pocket and we are planning with the group coming to St Petersburg in Ateljè

<p>
Last morning before the trip and still 15 open todo items, including insurance paperwork and some sushi. Next up is a company staff meeting...

<p>
Most work duties and insurance details are OK now, and Jose's bike parked near an inspection station. Cold beer and sunshine, then back to work.

<p>
Now the huge todo list of pre-trip stuff has been finished and I can rest. Looks like it will rain tomorrow but that is the norm for bike tours.

<p>
As per Kerttu's request, I made a guestimated travel route. This would go in the following fashion:
</p>

<p>
Helsinki, St. Petersburg (~3.7.-10.7.), Veliky Novgorod, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa (~17.7.), Sevastopol, Novorossijsk, Batumi, Trabzon, Istanbul (~25.7.), Sofia, Belgrad, Zagreb, Trieste, Milano, Zürich (~4.8.)
</p>

<p>
There are also many other fascinating places on the road, though. Will be interesting to see how well this estimate holds up.
</p>

<p>
Now the bags are packed and I'm ready. I only need to suit up and wake up Kerttu, and we should be able to start the trip with a sushi lunch.
