<p><a href="http://tamejs.org/">Tame.js</a> is an interesting new JavaScript transpiler that makes managing of asynchronous code easier. From the page:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tame (or &#8220;TameJs&#8221;) is an extension to JavaScript, written in JavaScript, that makes event programming easier to write, read, and edit. Tame is very easy to use in Node and other V8 projects. And it can be dropped into projects where desired - no need to rewrite any existing code.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The approach is slightly different from other Node.js asynchronous programming libraries, like <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">async</a>.</p>
