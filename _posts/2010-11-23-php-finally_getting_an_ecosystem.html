<p><img src="https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/1dff72a17ecddcaf72a11df85f553d3de64e756e756_elephphant.png" border="0" alt="PHP" title="PHP" align="right" style="float:right;" />One of my main concerns with PHP has been the lack of ecosystem. Almost all libraries and tools are written with a specific framework in mind, creating separate ecosystems around <a href="http://drupal.org/project/modules">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.11/">Zend Framework</a>, <a href="http://trac.midgard-project.org/browser/branches/ragnaroek/midcom">Midgard</a> and others instead of an ecosystem benefiting all users of the language.</p>
<p>There have been efforts at this, like PEAR before, but they have mostly stagnated. This is why I was really happy to see <a href="http://schlitt.info/opensource/blog/0737_apache_zeta_components_was_ez_components.html">a post</a> today on Planet PHP about the former <a href="http://ezcomponents.org/">eZ Components</a> library entering Apache incubation as <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/zetacomponents/">Zeta Components</a>. While <em>components</em> in the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/midcom/">Midgard terminology</a> mean full applications that can be plugged into your website (like <em>modules</em> in other ecosystems like Drupal), in case of Zeta Components the term means general purpose libraries:</p>
<blockquote>Apache Zeta Components are a high quality, general purpose library of loosly coupled components for development of applications based on PHP 5. Beside typical modules for web application development, like a Template engine, Database tools and an MVC component, Apache Zeta Components contain command line tools, a chart rendering library, a WebDAV server, a universal document conversion component and many more tools to ease developers live.</blockquote>
<p>This should be great news to anybody working with PHP. The current list of Zeta Components appears to provide a quite comprehensive <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk.html">list of useful libraries</a>, through Apache the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">licensing is very permissive</a>, and as <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/open_source-free_software-what_we_need_is_open_projects/">I've written before</a>, Apache has a great set of <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#management">guidelines</a> its projects must follow.</p>
<p>Zeta Components is certainly a project that I will be watching. And hopefully it can be a place where we can start contributing some of the generic PHP libraries and tools from the Midgard project. A first target that comes to mind is the <a href="https://github.com/bergie/midgardmvc_helper_location">generic geolocation library</a> that we have.</p>
