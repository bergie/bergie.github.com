In what is becoming a regular [spring][1] [ritual][2], the [Triumph Legend][3] is again having electric problems, this time with the starter engine.

A bike shop had already promised to fix the bike, but then they [screwed up][4]. So, if you know a bike maintenance shop in Helsinki region that could help with the Triumph, please [drop me a line][5].

__Updated 2005-05-24:__ I finally found a mechanic and after a bit of
wait, the bike was [towed away][6] today. The verdict: the starter engine had melted.

So now began the wait for a new starter... 

How long this will take is anybody's guess. So far the delivery times for parts from [Triumph][7] have been anything between week and over a month.

__Updated 2005-05-31:__ In a surprising turn of events, [Mp-Asennus][8] got the bike fixed in a day using a spare Kawasaki starter. Great work, thanks! Now the bike is running without problems.

Thanks to everybody for their good ideas and suggestions!
