The [FON WiFi community][1] is now offering [free Fonera access points in Finland][2]. FON allows you to share internet access with all other community members:

> FON is the largest WiFi community in the world. Our members share their wireless Internet access at home and, in return, enjoy free WiFi wherever they find another Fonero's Access Point.

> It all started as a simple idea. Why should you pay for Internet access on the go when you have already paid for it at home? Exactly, you shouldn't. So we decided to help create a community of people who get more out of their connection through sharing.

[The concept][4] sounds very promising. I've already ordered my access point, so later on [this network][3] will be part of the movement.

__Updated 2006-11-29:__ There is a FON-compatible [autologin applet][5] for GNOME that might be a useful thing to port to [Maemo][6]. This would be good not only for FON but also for other WiFi networks that require a web-based login like [TeliaSonera HomeRun][10] that we use.

Also, FON and [Plazes][8] are [planning to collaborate][7]. The ideas sound interesting...

> When Stefan and I were first thinking about Plazes it was clear to us, that networks are social entities. That people being connected to the same LAN or Hotspot not only share a common geography at a point in time but most likely also similar interests and ideas. Or put differently: A network is more than access, itÂ´s a cristallisation point for sociality. (Check out [Project Placesite][9] which pretty much does what we initially came up with.)
