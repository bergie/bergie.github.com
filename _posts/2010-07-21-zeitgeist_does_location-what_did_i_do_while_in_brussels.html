<p><a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com/">Zeitgeist</a>, the desktop activity logging engine is now becoming geo-aware. From <a href="http://seilo.geekyogre.com/2010/07/zeitgeist-geolocation-magic/">Seif Lotfy's blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows you to ask Zeitgeist stuff like</p>
<ul><li>“Get me the recent files I edited at university”</li>
<li>“Who do I contact most when I am at School?”</li>
<li>“Which pictures did I take in Brazil?”</li>
<li>“Where was I when an Email came in?”</li>
<li>“What files did I open during the conference?”</li>
</ul><img src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/1df94eaba47081894ea11df8003ad955f7114821482_zeitgeist-geoclue.jpg" border="0" alt="zeitgeist-geoclue.jpg" title="zeitgeist-geoclue.jpg" /></blockquote>
<p>As I've been <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/synchronization-and-the-free-software-desktop-in-guadec/">advocating since 2006</a>, location is important for making applications smarter. While you might not remember where you stored some file, you probably remember where you were when working on it. Then Zeitgeist's location features, powered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoClue">GeoClue</a>, will be able to get it for you.</p>
<p>This is especially cool since Zeitgeist is <a href="http://picasaweb.google.de/lh/photo/RWiWpFuwOMPQSvgNRFAgKA?feat=directlink">coming for Maemo</a> as well. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/2845863882/">My laptop</a> is quite mobile, but the N900 is even more so.</p>
