</p><p> I've worked together with <strong>Virpi Mikkonen</strong> and the rest of the Anttila team in several related projects, and they are really committed to the quality process. The projects we've implemented have included management of customer feedback using <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/openpsa/support.html">OpenPSA Support</a> and process diagram integration into their <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a>-powered Intranet.

Congratulations to everybody involved!
