Just in time for a new cruising season to start, the story of our [2021 Baltic shakedown cruise](https://meri-imperiumi.github.io/log/2021/) is now online.

This was a 666NM trip that we did on our new-to-us [Amigo 40 cruising boat](https://meri-imperiumi.github.io/log/boat/) in August-September 2021. Apart from engine trouble in the beginning, this was a very enjoyable little adventure on the coasts of Sweden and Bornholm.

The trip even earned us the first prize in the cruising log contest of [our sailing club](https://scgothia.de):
