</p><blockquote>
<a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">The Midgard Project</a> switched to a <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard_and_synchronized_releases/">new synchronized release model</a> with the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard/8.09/">8.09 "Ragnaroek LTS"</a> release. <a href="http://coccinella.im/synchronized-releases">Synchronized release model</a> means that a major release of Midgard will happen every six months, tuned to be part of the larger Linux software ecosystem <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/159">as described by Mark Shuttleworth</a>:
<br /><br /><em>WHAT IF you knew that the next long-term supported releases of Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat and Novell Linux would all have the same major versions of kernel, GCC, X, GNOME, KDE, OO.o and Mozilla. Would that make a major difference for you? Iâ€™m willing to bet not - that from a customer view, folks who prefer X will still prefer X. A person who prefers Red Hat will stick with Red Hat. But from a developer view, would that make it easier to collaborate? Dramatically so.
<br /><br />...</em>
<br /><br />The same model has been employed very successfully by major projects like <a href="http://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/TimeBased">GNOME</a>, <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Ganymede_Simultaneous_Release#Goal">Eclipse</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases">Ubuntu</a> distribution. As Midgard relies on <a href="http://blogs.nemein.com/people/piotras/view/1223463209.html">many GNOME technologies</a>, being in the same release cycle with them helps our development immensely, and makes Midgard more easy to install because we have a more stable set of dependencies.
