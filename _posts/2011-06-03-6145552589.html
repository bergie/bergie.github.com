<a href="http://ricostacruz.com/js2coffee/">JavaScript to CoffeeScript converter</a><br/><p>This is an interesting option for making older JS codebases more easily maintainable CS, or when dealing with large patches sent in JS format to a CS project.</p>

<p>On my quick test (converting <a href="https://github.com/bergie/hallo">Hallo</a> code to JavaScript, then back to CoffeeScript), the generated stuff is almost exactly the same than my original CoffeeScript. The main missing feature appears to be the bound function <em>=&gt;</em> syntax.</p>
