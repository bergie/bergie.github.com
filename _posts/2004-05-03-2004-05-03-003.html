This <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/developing_with_web_standards/">method of web design</a> is becoming increasingly popular, and for good reasons. For those who don't see the technical beauty of the solution as good enough reason, there are significant <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000266.php">business benefits</a> as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nemein.com/en/">We've</a> worked on migrating our projects to standards-based design since last December, and the results look quite good. The only major issue is the mark-up produced by our <a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/">WYSIWYG editor</a>. To fix this, we could either start using <a href="http://kupu.oscom.org/">OSCOM Kupu</a>, or run the content through <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>.<br />
