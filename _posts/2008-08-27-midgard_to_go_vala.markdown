</p><blockquote>
There is a project in works by me to rewrite Midgard’s core engine from plain C to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Midgard 8.09’s code is taking huge use of GObject infrastructure and Vala is so good in expressing GObjects that actual development is much much easier.
<br /><br />It is not surprising that the project itself will be code-named ‘Váli’. It will include both streamlining of Midgard core and use of SpiderMonkey java script language embedded engine (courtesy of Mozilla project) to allow server-side extension of the core. Some might see these changes as an attempt to bring more web developers to Midgard’s Core but as this will anyway happen after Ragnaroek, I think its pure target is to simplify work for remaining gods on a new world for mere humans.

I think the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/events/midgard_gathering_2008.html">Midgard Gathering</a> in November shall be quite memorable, and not only because of the quantities of Polish vodka and sauna that will be present...
