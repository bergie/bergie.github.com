<p>Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/12/28/Mobile-Market">on the new mobile market</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Tablets and handsets can displace computers as play and reading devices, but they really can't become dominant as work tools until we have a better solution for high-speed low-friction text input. On the other hand, I wouldn’t be surprised to see dramatic progress in this area; it’s so obviously the number-one usability barrier for everything that isn’t badged as a "computer".</blockquote>
<p>I've seen some interesting approaches at solving the text input problem. But the other option is of course that other means of communicating become more prominent: videos, audio messages, etc. <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/channels/show/SosiaalinenMedia/view/1e9f767618c411e0baf66f84d37e1a641a64/">A flickr is worth 50 tweets</a>, after all. But how do you program then?</p>
<p><strong>Updated:</strong> Alex Payne thinks <a href="http://al3x.net/2011/01/10/a-thought-on-communication.html">video will replace textual communication</a>:</p>
<blockquote>My generation will be at something of a loss when this new world comes about. In my life, I’ve been rewarded for communicating effectively online via text. I’m a reasonably effective verbal communicator, but not nearly as good as I’ll need to be to compete with the telepresence-native adults that the children of today will grow up to be. <br /><br /> Today’s digital natives will be tomorrow’s telegraph operators. The only way to survive will be to understand the impact of pervasive video communication before it sweeps us under our keyboards.</blockquote>
