I returned from a trip to Lapland and Russia today, and noticed that the battery of my [Macbook][1] had somehow died while I was away. Now the computer doesn't recognize it at all.

This means I have no possibilities for using the laptop while traveling to Turku for the weekend and to Tampere next week for the [OpenMind conference][2], unless the Mac store is able to replace the battery tomorrow morning.

Since the fate of the computer is uncertain I decided to secure at least some entertainment for the trips in form of watching movies on my [Nokia 770][5]. The [conversion procedure from DVDs][3] to the format supported by the tiny device is fairly easy using the [HandBrake][4] movie converter.

So far the results look quite promising:

Now what remains to be seen is how long the battery of the Nokia device lasts when watching movies.

__Updated 2006-10-22:__ I watched the 30s classic aviation film [Hell's Angels][6] on a train ride from Helsinki to Turku yesterday. The movie was definitely watchable on the 770 screen, and the 2 hour trip used one fourth of the battery (as shown by the indicator).
