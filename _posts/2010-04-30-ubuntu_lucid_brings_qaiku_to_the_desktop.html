<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/1004features">Ubuntu 10.04 LTS "Lucid Lynx"</a> was released yesterday. Among other new features it includes the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2010/03/hands-on-ubuntu-goes-social-gains-me-menu-in-1004-alpha-3.ars">Me Menu</a>, bringingÂ your social networks right into the desktop. <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/">Qaiku</a>, the Finnish <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/microblogging-why_qaiku_might_do_what_twitter_and_brightkite_didn-t/">conversational microblogging service</a> is included:</p>

<p>All in all, Lucid seems like a very smooth Linux desktop experience. I'm also happy other changes we've pushed for like <a href="http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/whats-new-php-5-3">PHP 5.3</a> are included. Maybe in the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/04/ubuntu-1010-to-be-codenamed-maverick-meerkat.ars">next release cycle</a> we can start thinking of bringing <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/making_the_gnome_desktop_location-aware/">geolocation to the desktop</a>...</p>
