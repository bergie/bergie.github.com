<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/apple-announces-ipad-attempts-to-change-the-world.ars">Apple iPad</a> is certainly interesting. It seeks to <a href="http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2010/01/ipad-attempted-windows-killer_27.html">challenge the concept  of PCs</a> by providing something that is at the same time more personal,  and a lot easier to use. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/27/ipad/">The personal computer of the future</a>.<br /><br /> Gone is difficult file organization - instead, applications use their  <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/will_content_repositories_kill_the_file/">own purpose-build content repositories</a>. Instead of seeking software from  many places, all of it is easily available in an App Store, all  <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134960/2008/08/appstore.html">quality-controlled by Apple</a>. And same thing with content - <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/amazon_kindle_could_be_the_library_of_the_working_nomad/">forget about  bookshelves</a> and stacks of CDs, instead simply dowloading all you need  from iTunes.<br /><br /> This sort of user experience obviously <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/ipad">comes with a cost</a>. Important  computing concepts <a href="http://www.theiphoneblog.com/2010/01/27/ipad-multitasking-notifications-tv-subscriptions-camera-tethering-textbooks/">like multitasking are not supported</a>. The  iTunes/App Store experience means that Apple <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/01/protestors-ipad-is-nothing-more-than-a-golden-calf-of-drm.ars">is in the position to  ensure</a> no software or content competing with its or its business  partners' business model gets on the device. And most of the content you  buy for the device is <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm">DRM'd</a>, meaning that you're only renting it for  the time allowed by content owners, never buying.<br /><br /> Even with the limitations concerned I can see myself buying an iPad. It  would serve as a very nice device for web surfing from the couch and as  an e-reader on business trips. I can also see myself <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/01/what-the-ipad-means-for-startu.php">running demos</a> and  presentations from it instead of a laptop.<br /><br /> Even with the limitations concerned, it is likely that the iPad will  happen, and will blaze the trail towards a new way of personal  computing. <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/2010/01/28/ipad-about/">Stephen Fry says it well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Like the first iPhone, iPad 1.0 is a John the Baptist preparing the way  of what is to come, but also like iPhone 1.0 (and Jokanaan himself too  come to that) iPad 1.0 is still fantastic enough in its own right to be  classed as a stunningly exciting object, one that you will want NOW and  one that will not be matched this year by any company. In the future,  when it has two cameras for fully featured video conferencing, GPS and  who knows what else built in (1080 HD TV reception and recording and  nano projection, for example) and when the iBook store has recorded its  100 millionth download and the thousands of accessories and peripherals  that have invented uses for iPad that we simply can’t now imagine – when  that has happened it will all have seemed so natural and inevitable  that today’s nay-sayers and sceptics will have forgotten that they ever doubted its potential.</blockquote>
<p>The success of iPad will mean more than just a completely new level of App  Store economy. Other companies will certainly seek to emulate the model,  coming up with their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-WIMP">post-WIMP</a> devices and their <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/26/nokia-ovi-store-now-live-everywhere/">own content and  software ecosystems</a>. This all will be a challenge for the free software  movement.<br /><br /> The world of free software is still very much stuck in what computing  was in the 90s. We think of desktop computers, we <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/free_desktop_and_the_cloud/">do not integrate with  the web</a>. And we do not get the transformation that is happening with  personal computers. Taught by smartphones and cloud applications, users  are moving from desktops through simple netbooks towards <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5452501/the-apple-tablet-interface-must-be-like-this">information  appliances</a>.<br /><br /> With information appliances you need <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/direct_manipulation_interfaces/">a seamless user interface</a>. You need  an ecosystem where content comes alongside the software to utilize it.  You need to move past the old WIMP metaphors and the idea of separation  between data stored in a a file system and the software manipulating it.<br /><br /> So far the first convincing attempt towards this direction I've seen in  the free software world is <a href="http://www.socialdesktop.org/">KDE's Social Desktop initiative</a>. It allows  users to connect with each other straight through the desktop, and it  allows discovery of new applications and content to download and use  straight in the applications. We also use it with <a href="http://danielwilms.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/download-assistant-for-extras-applications/">Maemo's new App  Downloader</a>.<br /><br /> Threatened by the cloud from one end, and closed-ecosystem appliances  from the other, it will be interesting to see how we react. Will we rise  to the challenge and start providing new user experiences? Will we  build a free cloud? Will we integrate with initiatives like <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project  Gutenberg</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> to provide the content integration? Will <a href="http://openwebfoundation.org/"> the open web</a> be our safe haven?<br /><br /> Definitely interesting times to be a software developer.</p>
