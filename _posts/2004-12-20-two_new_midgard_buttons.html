<a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/whoswho/spike_spiegel.html">Alexey Zakhlestine</a> has designed two new "Powered by Midgard" buttons users can display on their site to support the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/cms/">CMS project</a>:

Reminded by this, I uploaded a bunch of <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/communications/buttons.html">other Midgard buttons</a> to the project site as well.

<strong>In the other news,</strong> today's main activity was creating an <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/openpsa/sales.html">OpenPSA Sales</a> based storage back-end for a major consumer competition run by <a href="http://www.a-lehdet.fi/">A-lehdet</a>. The competition site is completely built in Flash and sends vote and registration data via a HTTP POST to <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a>.
</p>

<p>
It will be interesting to see how the solution, and especially the campaign user interface in Sales will handle the expected 100,000 registrations. I expect we will have to lighten the campaign member listing screen quite a bit. I'll post some technical notes and code related to this later when the campaign goes live.

<strong>The other activity today</strong> was a demonstration against closing the <a href="http://pelastamalmi.org/en/">historical Helsinki-Malmi airport</a>. There were about 150-200 aviators gathered in front of the city hall, and the air was filled with chants and supporting horns of passing cars. My <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/historical_helsinki-malmi_airport_threatened.html">yesterday's blog post</a> about this got some attention from the <a href="http://www.hel.fi/paatoksenteko/valtujas.html">city council members</a>, including several very supportive emails. It actually seems to have started a small flamewar within the group.
</p>

<p>
I've posted some <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/gallery/2004/efhf-demonstration/">photos from the demonstration</a>. It was also covered in the newscast of <a href="http://www.uudenmaanuutiset.fi/">Uudenmaan Uutiset</a> and in a brief <a href="http://www.helsinginsanomat.fi/tuoreet/artikkeli/1101978050832">Helsingin Sanomat article</a>.
