[N800][1], the successor to Nokia's [770][24] [Maemo-powered][2] Linux internet tablet was apparently unleashed yesterday by [CompUSA][4]. While Nokia's site is [still quiet][5] on the new device, there are already [unboxing pictures][6] out there.

I've been using my 770 quite actively as a mobile internet terminal since I [got it][3] in February last year. While the [software is occasionally buggy][7], it still beats lugging my [MacBook][8] around or trying to browse the web with my cellphone.

In addition to browsing I'm [using][17] the [Jabber/Google Talk][18] feature of the device quite often, and also sometimes [watch movies on the go][9] with it. There are [other cool apps][23], too, and when my [hard drive died][10] and on the [Death Monkey Rally][11], 770 was my only computer.

While the current uses make the device already quite useful, I'd love to use it as a [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy][12], automatically finding [Wikipedia][13] information about things [near me][14]. When [Maemo-Blog][15] improves a bit, the device may also become an useful tool for maintaining a [travel journal][16], especially since the application is able to communicate [my coordinates][25] to the blog.

As [WiFi is becoming more ubiquitous][22] there definitely is demand for small and portable internet access devices. The new device [has more power][19] and is reputedly more stable, and so sounds like a worthy upgrade. In addition to buying a couple for the company, I'd love to get one for [Piotras][20] in order to get [Midgard libraries][21] ported there.
