<a href="http://downloads.maemo.org/">Maemo Downloads</a>, the application catalog for <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/phones/n800">Nokia internet tablets</a> is again open for business.

For some time users have not been able to authenticate to the service with their <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/">Garage accounts</a> to add or update applications, but this has been fixed now. The problem was incorrectly configured access controls in the Garage postgres database. So, please go ahead and <a href="http://test.maemo.org/support/application-catalog/developer-manual.html" title="Application catalog usage instructions">update any apps</a> that have been changed in the meanwhile!

In addition to fixing the authentication we have also added support for rating and commenting applications. For example, see the <a href="http://downloads.maemo.org/product/maemo-mapper/">Maemo Mapper entry</a>:

</span>The ratings differ from some other rating systems in the sense that every rating is accompanied by a comment and the name of the person who rated the app. To rate applications, log in to the catalog.

In near future we will start using rating as a sorting (and possibly filtering) criteria on the site.
