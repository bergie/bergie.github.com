Discussing on how Open Source software might still amount to similar customer lock-in as proprietary systems

Cnet has an interesting story [Open source versus open standards](http://news.com.com/2010-1071-995823.html) discussing how Open Source software might still amount to similar customer lock-in as proprietary systems.

This is definitely an important consideration, especially in a field as fractured as [Open Source CMS](http://www.oscom.org/) (there are at least 95 Open Source Content Management Systems). It is still impossible to convert your site, tools or workflow definitions between different Open Source CMSs despite efforts like [Portable Site Information Project](http://psilib.sourceforge.net/).

Each different CMS has its own target group and strong points. Requirements of websites may change as they (and their owner organizations) evolve, and so being able to [replace](http://www.zope-europe.org/articles/200302/replaceability) the Content Management System would be beneficial.

If there were open standards that many Open Source CMSs implemented, it would be much easier for site developers to get started using a system, as they wouldn't have to be afraid of getting stuck with their initial choices.

This is important consideration when we start talking about the [Project Ragnaroek](http://midgard-project.org/midgard1) and supporting standards like [WebDAV](http://www.webdav.org/) within the Midgard framework. If we support the open standards of our area, potential users are more eager to try our system out.
