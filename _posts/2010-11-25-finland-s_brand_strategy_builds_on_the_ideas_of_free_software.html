The basic idea is to promote the Finnish capability for getting things done, and the communal approach to problem solving.</p>
<p>I found the beginning of the <a href="http://www.tehtavasuomelle.fi/documents/TS_Finland_it_works_A4_EN.pdf">Finland - It Works</a> document particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Just a hobby, won’t be big and professional" 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 Newsgroups: comp.os.minix</em><br /><br /> This statement sparked a revolution. The amateur computer programmer Linus Torvalds had come up with a way of enabling an unlimited number of people to work on the development of the same program source code. This was to prove to be a highly successful approach. Linux, which since then has evolved into a huge success, is one of the most significant open-source operating systems. The Internet would not be possible without a service infrastructure, which is currently largely based on Linux and open source. <br /><br /> Torvalds understood that a complex system, such as a global network, can only function if there are a large number of motivated individuals contributing to its development. This is expressed in another famous statement made by Torvalds: "Given enough eyeballs, any bugs are shallow". In other words, the difficulty of problems depends on the number of people involved in finding a solution.<br /><br />Linux, which was created by Torvalds, and other open source systems combine the foremost virtues of Finnish functionality: nurturing the commons in a successful way, and the shrewd use of human resources. Thus it is probably no coincidence that the main impetus for open source came from Finland, from a country where functionality is the highest praise for almost anything.</blockquote>
<p>I would imagine this is the first time a country uses <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/open_source-free_software-what_we_need_is_open_projects/">FOSS philosophy</a> as one of the building blocks for a national strategy.</p>
<p>If you have the time, go to the <a href="http://www.tehtavasuomelle.fi/">project website</a> and read the materials. They seem to have some interesting suggestions on how to move Finland's public image forward.</p>
