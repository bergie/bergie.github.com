[OpenPsa][1] appears on [Best help desk software guide][2]:

> We have made our OpenPSA demo server publicly available. Get the address and user accounts from the OpenPSA demo page. OpenPSA is an Open Source Professional Services Automation system built on top of Midgard and PHP. The system provides management tools for software companies and consultancies. The modules include project management, CRM, help desk and group calendaring.

The site seems quite a lot like a [splog][3] to me.
