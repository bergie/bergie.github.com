<blockquote>The answer is, we use an open-source platform called "Midgard." We picked it nearly ten years ago, and it has held up fairly well.<br />...<br /><br /> One of the things we like about Midgard actually makes it rather unsuitable for many simpler publishing scenarios: it is highly object-oriented. This allows us to run multiple sites off largely a single codebase -- at the cost of quite user-unfriendly administrative and authoring facilities.<br /><br /> Also, Midgard is very much a development platform, and we have had to create a fair amount of custom code, especially to handle structured content. In that regard, our CMS experience probably resemble yours. As an industry we remain very far from plug-and-play content management technology for all but the simplest of websites.</blockquote>
<p>While the post contains many negative points about <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard/">older Midgard</a> (the UIs are <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard-s-new-toolbar/">a bit better now</a> than they used to be, quite a lot of development has since <a href="http://trac.midgard-project.org/timeline">been happening</a> especially in <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/long-term_support_for_midgard-ragnaroek_is_here/">the LTS branch</a>), it is remarkable that <a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/">CMS Watch</a> has been able to run their services through the <em>same CMS setup for ten years</em>. This really shows the durability and commitment to long-term stability we have in the Midgard community. We've been doing this for <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/first_ten_years_of_midgard/">more than ten years</a>, and will likely keep going for quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>As for usability and popularity of Midgard, there is quite little we can do about it in the Midgard1 area, as that is now in <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/long-term_support_for_midgard-ragnaroek_is_here/">long-term support</a> phase that won't allow major changes. But <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/raise_the_hammer-midgard2_mjolnir_goes_live/">Midgard2 is a new world</a> with new opportunities. Midgard's <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application/">content repository</a> is pretty much there already, as is the MVC layer, and this spring we should be able to unveil the new, quite revolutionary CMS concept as well.
