[Camino][1] is the [Mozilla family][2] browser tailored for Mac desktop. Version 1.0 was released on Feb 14th, and I'm now trying it as a new default browser to replace [Firefox][3]:

On a quick look, Camino looks better and seems a bit faster. It also fixes a critical problem I had with Firefox 1.5, the time the software was frozen to open new windows. With Camino, pop-ups and download windows open briskly.

All the regular web features I use work with Camino: Bookmarklets, AJAX, Google Maps, HtmlArea etc. However, missing [RSS auto-discovery][4] is a bit of an issue.

I noticed the state of Camino via [Mezzoblue][5].
