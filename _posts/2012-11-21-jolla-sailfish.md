*I'm in Helsinki today in order to cover Jolla's Sailfish OS launch event in the [Slush](http://slush.fi/en/) conference. This post will be updated as the day progresses, so keep hitting reload or following the [RSS feed](/blog/category/mobility/rss.xml). I recommend reading my [Dreams of the MeeGo Diaspora](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/meego-diaspora/) post before this one to get the background on where Jolla comes from.*
