*I'm in Helsinki today in order to cover Jolla's Sailfish OS launch event in the [Slush](http://slush.fi/en/) conference. This post will be updated as the day progresses, so keep hitting reload or following the [RSS feed](/blog/category/mobility/rss.xml).*

*I will be interviewing some Jolla team members in the afternoon. If you have questions you'd like to get asked, please add them to the comments below.*

This week has been a busy one for a [hacker-nomad](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/hacker-nomadism/). Weekend in Paris for the JS.Everywhere conference, then on Monday a talk at the Hamburg JavaScript meetup. And now I'm in Helsinki. Slush, the conference I'm attending, is the biggest start-up event in Nordic countries. But even at that, it seems the Jolla announcements of today have been able to hijack most of the buzz around the event.

Thanks to the kind invitation from the Jolla team, I will spend today in the conference. This post will include the things I learn about Sailfish, their new mobile OS. I've been equipped with a list of questions from the Maemo community, and will try to pry answers to some of those during the day. In the meanwhile, I recommend reading my [Dreams of the MeeGo Diaspora](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/meego-diaspora/) post before this one to get the background on where Jolla comes from.

## What to expect from the day

Unlike with the smartphone giants, relatively little has leaked out on what Jolla will show us today. What we know is that they are working on a new OS for smartphones based on [Mer](http://merproject.org/) and Qt. During Slush they will show the user interface and the SDK, but there should be no hardware announcements yet.

Jolla Tides has a list of [various gossip about the event](http://jollatides.com/2012/11/16/5-days-to-go-some-more-gossip-in-the-grain/). We'll see how much of that holds true.

## Before the opening session

I arrived at Slush right around when the doors opened. Quite a few members of the Jolla team were there already to set up their booth and prepare for the keynote. Looking at all the familiar faces makes this feel very much like a Maemo family gathering.

The Jolla booth is right next to the main entrance. And there are stickers:

Before the event started, Jolla's CEO *Marc Dillon* shared the stage in the opening press conference with other Finnish start-up notables like *Peter Vesterbacka* from Rovio.

Jolla has grown very quickly from a start-up to a medium-sized technology company.

The fact that Finland's prime minister will be opening the actual event shows how important innovative new companies like Jolla are for the nation.

## Opening session

Peter Vesterbacka:

> This is not California. Most of the year it is cold, dark, and there is slush on the ground. But this is also an advantage. You have time to build amazing things like IRC, Linux, or Angry Birds

In addition to Finnish companies, there are also 100 Russian start-ups attending.

> If you look at the markets nearby, there are places like Russia and China practically next door.

Jyrki Katainen, Finnish PM:

> I've never before been in an event where the prime minister's nails get painted. Innovation.

![Jyrki Katainen](/files/slush12_opening_katainen.jpg)

> But seriously, we as a country have been losing market share in many important markets. The ways to solve this is through research and entrepreneurship. The focus on R&D was what lifted Finland from the recession of the early 90s. We want to become the largest hub of start-ups in Northern Europe. We need to create an atmosphere where new entrepreneurs and venture capitalists can meet in easier ways.

### Before the keynote

Jolla's website is finally up at <http://jolla.com/>. The website is also showing the event livestream:

There is also a [wiki for Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Main_Page) now available.

Another exciting pre-keynote announcement is that Finnish operator [DNA will sell Jolla phones](http://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/jollapuhelimet+tulevat+myyntiin+suomessa/a2156416).

[This](https://twitter.com/JollaSuomi/status/271178889261355010) is also interesting, if true:

## Jolla launch keynote

*For those unable to be here in person, there is [a livestream available](http://new.livestream.com/slushlive/mainstage).*

> 2013 will not be like 2013

The whole company came on stage, and each team was introduced with words like:

> Here is the team that designs the most innovative user experience. We have the team that works to put Sailfish on all sorts of hardware. All hardware, whether high or low end, has been performing extremely well with Sailfish. We've been responsible for finding the best engineering talent in the world. We take care of systems, tools, and automation -- yeah, we build robots

Marc Dillon:

> We have the world's best community behind us. There is such a need for another player in the mobile space. People need change, people need openness

> We want to be a company that sells a great user experience, a great operating system. Jolla is not a company. Jolla is a movement

Jolla wants to add more partners to the ecosystem, and to ensure it is an open ecosystem where companies can put Sailfish on different kinds of devices, and create new things on the platform.

> It is a lot of fun what we do every day. I work with the greatest people in the world. The UI should also be fun for the users, for the consumers. We're out there creating friendships and partnerships. It is all about working bilaterally.

> We've seen a company to build a business out of apps, and another company follow them on their terms. We don't have to do that.

> The governance of Sailfish is about contributing. If a company wants to add a new technology or a standard, we're open for that.

China is the first market for Jolla. Sami PienimÃ¤ki on stage:

> We're taking Finnish design and bringing it to China. Many people around the world have told us that what you're trying can't be done, that there is a *Red Sea* to block you. But China is the most dynamic market in the world. You need to listen carefully and be polite, and always learn. The management team is constantly on the field. You can't outsource this, you need to feel it yourself

> *"China is a big country inhabited by many Chinese"* - Charles de Gaulle. *"No problem"* - Chinese saying

Stefano Mosconi:

> Our guys are really staying up until 4am to see that we have Sailfish OS booting on the new hardware. This doesn't happen every day. This is Open Source, it is stubborness, it is great engineering. Open Source is about doing stuff.

> What if you could watch the development of the OS out in the open, and adapt your application little by little, instead of having to wait for the big code drop? Sailfish is the first mobile operating system that is really open 24 hours for your contributions, and your enjoyment.

> You out there are the interconnected organisms. We want to swim in the Open Source, we want to live and breath it. And when you're in the ecosystem, you can contribute, you can affect the way things go.

The SDK is based on Qt Creator and will be shown tomorrow.
