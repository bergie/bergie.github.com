*I'm in Helsinki today in order to cover Jolla's Sailfish OS launch event in the [Slush](http://slush.fi/en/) conference. This post will be updated as the day progresses, so keep hitting reload or following the [RSS feed](/blog/category/mobility/rss.xml).*

*I will be interviewing some Jolla team members in the afternoon. If you have questions you'd like to get asked, please add them to the comments below.*

This week has been a busy one for a [hacker-nomad](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/hacker-nomadism/). Weekend in Paris for the JS.Everywhere conference, then on Monday a talk at the Hamburg JavaScript meetup. And now I'm in Helsinki. Slush, the conference I'm attending, is the biggest start-up event in Nordic countries. But even at that, it seems the Jolla announcements of today have been able to hijack most of the buzz around the event.

Thanks to the kind invitation from the Jolla team, I will spend today in the conference. This post will include the things I learn about Sailfish, their new mobile OS. I've been equipped with a list of questions from the Maemo community, and will try to pry answers to some of those during the day. In the meanwhile, I recommend reading my [Dreams of the MeeGo Diaspora](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/meego-diaspora/) post before this one to get the background on where Jolla comes from.

## What to expect from the day

Unlike with the smartphone giants, relatively little has leaked out on what Jolla will show us today. What we know is that they are working on a new OS for smartphones based on [Mer](http://merproject.org/) and Qt. During Slush they will show the user interface and the SDK, but there should be no hardware announcements yet.

Jolla Tides has a list of [various gossip about the event](http://jollatides.com/2012/11/16/5-days-to-go-some-more-gossip-in-the-grain/). We'll see how much of that holds true.

## Before the keynote

I arrived at Slush right around when the doors opened. Quite a few members of the Jolla team were there already to set up their booth and prepare for the keynote. Looking at all the familiar faces makes this feel very much like a Maemo family gathering.

The Jolla booth is right next to the main entrance.
