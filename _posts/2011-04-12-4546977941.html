title: Node.js for Python Developers

<blockquote>Pythonistas could think of Node.js as the JavaScript equivalent of CPython, Twisted, and setuptools packaged together in a single binary residing server-side. It includes a package repository (npm), and is all about event-driven I/O. That means that every time you make a call that would block, you pass a callback to it, kind of like how Twisted’s Deferreds work.</blockquote>&#8212;Pete Hunt <a href="http://www.petehunt.net/blog/?p=26">explains Node.js</a> to Python developers
