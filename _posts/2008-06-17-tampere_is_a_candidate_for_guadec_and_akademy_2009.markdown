<a href="http://guadec.expectnation.com/public/content/main">GUADEC</a> and <a href="http://akademy.kde.org/">aKademy</a> will possibly be arranged together in 2009. As the events are looking for a venue, we at <a href="http://www.coss.fi/web/coss/home">COSS</a> (Centre for Open Source Solutions Finland) decided <a href="http://www.coss.fi/web/coss/news?p_p_id=86">to apply</a> to have the events in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere">Tampere</a>, Finland.

Tampere is an old industrial city situated between two lakes. It has quite good flight connections (including <a href="http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/">Ryanair</a>) to Europe, and fast rail link to nearby Helsinki which is the big hub for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnair">Finnair</a>. COSS is a seasoned <a href="http://www.coss.fi/web/openmind">conference organizer </a>with good connections to local and country-level instances, and as venue we can have the <a href="http://www.uta.fi/english/">University of Tampere</a> campus.
