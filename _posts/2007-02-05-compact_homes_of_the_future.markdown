Now that <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/personalized_street_advertisements/">advertisements recognize you</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/01/31/commence-holding-breath-x-hawk-flying-car-could-be-here-by-2010/">flying cars</a> are coming, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_Royale_%282006_film%29">a Bond movie</a> mostly uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_gadgets#Casino_Royale_.282006_version.29">off-the-shelf technology</a>, we can say <a href="http://www.retrofuture.com/" title="The future the way it was sold to us">the future</a> is really here.

Fittingly, the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2005/12/10/pmicro10.xml&amp;grid=A1">apartments of future</a> are coming too, and they seem to be <a href="http://www.microcompacthome.com/index.php" title="Micro Compact Home">small and disposable</a>:
<blockquote>The micro compact home [m-ch] is a lightweight compact dwelling for one or two people. Its compact dimensions of 2.6m cube adapt it to a variety of sites and circumstances, and its functioning spaces of sleeping, working / dining, cooking and hygiene make it suitable for everyday use.</blockquote><img src="https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/microcompacthome-smart.jpg" height="210" width="400" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Microcompacthome-Smart" />

While if taken to extremes, we could have <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/4/3/19455/41933" title="T.E.U. short story on Kuroshin">quite a mobile dystopia</a>, the compact and movable homes <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/01/after_two_month.php">definitely have an appeal</a>. Smaller spaces seem to be the only way to prevent stuff from <a href="http://thefamilyceo.blogspot.com/2006/08/relationship-between-clutter-and-debt.html" title="The Relationship Between Clutter and Debt">accumulating</a> when living in the western society. And as <a href="http://blogit.digitoday.fi/teknobeduiini/life-management-matter-vs-experiences" title="Technobeduin on Life Management: Matter vs. experiences">experiences are much more valuable than stuff</a>, this is bad.

Makes me think, especially as I have to find a new apartment by the end of July anyway.
