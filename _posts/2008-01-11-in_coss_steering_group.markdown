COSS consists of 125 Finnish Open Source companies, several universities and public administration.

My company <a href="http://www.nemein.com/">Nemein</a> has been a <a href="http://directories.coss.fi/fi/yrityshakemisto/yritykset/df06f0852631363ed8b82ea3801f1c9b.html">COSS member</a> for quite a while and benefited from the <a href="http://coss.fi/web/coss/casesnnewsletters/4-02openpsa">publicity</a> and collaborative efforts in the organization. An important part of our work with COSS was the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/first-look-at-digital-business-ecosystem/">Digital Business Ecosystem project</a> where we developed some P2P <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/networked-project-management-with-dbe/">inter-company project management tools</a> and did some <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/digital-business-ecosystem-in-fisl/">evangelization work</a> in various conferences.

So when the annual members' meeting came last December I thought it was time to give back a bit. I volunteered and was elected as the small business representative in the <a href="http://www.coss.fi/web/coss/organization">COSS steering group</a> for the 2008-2009 term.

During the term I especially want to focus on enabling us small companies to work together more efficiently through networking. I also want to build some collaboration with Europe-wide organizations like <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>, which I'm a <a href="https://www.fsfe.org/en">fellow</a> of.

As my first COSS assignment I'm currently meeting representatives of other European Open Source business associations in Berlin. Stay tuned for more on that.
