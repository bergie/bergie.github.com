<a href="http://www.lyra.org/greg/">Greg Stein</a>, of WebDAV, SVN and ASF fame, <a href="http://feedblog.org/2007/08/27/greg-stein-director-of-the-apache-software-foundation-was-mugged-accepting-donations/">got violently mugged last Friday</a> in Mountain View:
<blockquote><p>They gave Greg a black eye and a serious laceration to the head which required numerous stiches. Apparently, he was bleeding profusely when the ambulance came.</p>
<p>The doctors were worried about his head wound and he spent the entire night under observation and went through numerous CAT scans.</p>
<p>A few weeks prior, he broke one of his legs and had been on crutches when these guys decided to beat the hell out of him.</p>
<p>What did they get? One hundred dollars and a credit card.</p></blockquote>Ouch.

When I got <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/when_a_holiday_gets-interesting/">drugged and robbed in Czech Republic</a> last June, I was quite down because of it for weeks. I'm sure getting mugged is even worse. So, to cheer him up, some people have started <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/08/27/how-do-we-take-care-of-each-other/">a PayPal fundraiser</a> to send him on a holiday. Overflow will be donated to Apache Software Foundation.

I know Greg from the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/">OSCOM</a> circles, and it really sucks that this happened to him.
