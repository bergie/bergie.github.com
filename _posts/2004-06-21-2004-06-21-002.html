Using standard CSS classes was one of the ideas I posted on <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004/2004-05-24-001.html">practical CMS interop</a>. If different <a href="http://www.oscom.org/matrix/index.html">Content Management Systems</a> and web scripts could standardize on these keeping layouts synchronized between them would be very easy.<br /><br />In his follow-up, Andy provides a more detailed list and structure of <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/whats_in_a_name_pt2.html">IDs to use</a>. This could well be the starting point for standardization.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 2004-06-23 16:20:</span> <a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/">Gregor J. Rothfuss</a> followed up on the idea, and <a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/archives/001730.html">proposed an OSCOM skin repository</a> of CSS styles for the common elements.<br /><br />The story was also <a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/News/Article/?319">picked up by CMS Watch</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 2004-08-11 14:24:</span> Thorsten Scherler will hold a <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/skins">session on CSS naming conventions</a> on Sep. 29th in the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4">OSCOM 4</a> conference in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.<br />
