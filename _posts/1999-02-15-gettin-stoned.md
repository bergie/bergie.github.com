Bergie switches job and becomes the webmaster of a network security software company.

This had long been in coming. The time to quit my web designer's work in [HyperHouse](http://www.hyperhouse.com), and move on to greener pastures.

So, starting from this day, I will be the webmaster of StoneSoft, an Espoo-based software company specializing in network security software.

The company seems to be intent on pushing its website towards the possibilities offered by new technologies, including web application servers like Midgard.

So, this is also to say, that my old email address at HyperHouse is not functioning any more. So on any sort of business, you should rather see my Contact Information -page for more current addresses.
