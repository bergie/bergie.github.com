My 180 days long military service begins tomorrow, so I'm now going offline. As my email connectivity will be unsteady at best, I'll unsubscribe the Midgard mailing lists now.

I will still be reading my personal email address (Henri.Bergius@iki.fi) every now and then, so you can contact me by using that. For urgent matters, please also contact Laeticia Soderman (lettu@greywolves.org), so she can get the word to me.

I hope to work actively with Midgard again after my service ends. In the meanwhile, thanks to you all for being part of this community, it has been a great year working with you all!
