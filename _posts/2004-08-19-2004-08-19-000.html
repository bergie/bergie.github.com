<p>The connection went down first time around noon, and returned after 2pm. Now the connection has been down since around 3:45pm.</p>
<p>When trying to reach Elisa's <a href="http://www.elisa.fi/index.cfm?t=2" title="Elisa's Corporate Network Solutions site in Finnish">Network solutions</a> site to find out when things will start working again, the ColdFusion server only responds with:</p>

<blockquote>
An error occurred while attempting to establish a connection to the server.
<br /><br />
The most likely cause of this problem is that the server is not currently running. Verify that the server is running and restart it if necessary.
<br /><br />
Unix error number 146 occurred: Connection refused

<p>Finnish Teleservice Center (FTC) has <a title="FTC's announcement on Elisa's network outages" href="http://www.ftc.fi/ajankohtaista/2004-08-19-000.html">an announcement</a> about the situation. Elisa hasn't given any information on when the network will be up again, and their <a title="Elisa's announcement page in Finnish" href="http://www.elisa.fi/ir/index.cfm?t=5&o=5100.00&redir=pressitiedotteet.cfm">announcements page</a> is also silent on the issue.<br /></p>
<p>This outage has again reminded me about the importance of having local copies of data. For example, I can't send any invoices because our <a title="OpenPSA - Open Professional Services Automation" href="http://www.openpsa.org/">OpenPSA</a> installation is in the affected network. Time to create a <a title="Repligard, Midgard's replication utility" href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/concepts/repligard/">replicated</a> setup of the important data? That would help offline working as well.<br /></p>
<p>Luckily my blog is hosted by <a title="Torben Nehmer, Nehmer.net Internet Services" href="http://www.nathan-syntronics.de/me/bewerbung/">Nehmer.net</a> in Germany instead.<br />
