[From Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/14/nokia-hires-peter-skillman-former-palm-design-vp-as-meego-user/)

I got to play with a Palm Pre in FOSDEM and the user experience absolutely rocks. Exactly the kind of hire Nokia needed to make :-)

Engadget also had a a story [about the WeTab MeeGo tablet](http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/14/neofonie-wetab-hands-on/):

WeTab actually sounds very interesting. They [posted to MeeGo forums](http://forum.meego.com/showthread.php?t=1266&highlight=wetab&page=3):

> We support Qt 4.6 and will update to 4.7, once it is stable. Qt is the framework, which we prefer, but nevertheless we support GTK based apps as well as java, flash, air, android apps (last ones are running in a complete android 2.2 in virtualbox).
