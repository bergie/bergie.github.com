Because of time constraints I have not been flying as much as I should. However, if I want to keep <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/it-is-now-done.html">my license</a> current that has to change.

The first step in regaining my wings was taken last weekend, flying to Turku with <a href="http://tigert.com/">Tigert</a> in an amazingly clear winter weather.
