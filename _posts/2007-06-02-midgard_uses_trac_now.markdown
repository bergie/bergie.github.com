We've just switched [Midgard](http://www.midgard-project.org/) and [MidCOM](http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/midcom/) to use the [Trac project infrastructure](http://trac.edgewall.org/). Seems very nice, especially as it uses [Midgard site accounts](http://www.midgard-project.org/community/account/register/midgard_users.html) for authentication.

Browse it in <http://trac.midgard-project.org/>
