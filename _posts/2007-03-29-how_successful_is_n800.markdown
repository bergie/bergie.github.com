As a <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo</a> application developer, I of course wonder how many <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/N800">N800</a> or <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/770">770</a> internet tablets are out there. Nokia hasn't released any figures as far as I know, but looking at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/ref=sv_pc_1/104-3664075-5639924">Amazon's Computers &#38; PC Hardware top sellers</a>, it seems that at least N800 is selling well. Today it was on sixth place, behind some different MacBook and Toshiba Satellite iterations:

Advertisements for N800 also seem to be popping up quite frequently both online and in magazines, so it seems Nokia is really pushing this product. However, I have yet to see somebody outside our small geek circle using the device in public.

<strong>Updated 2007-04-02:</strong> During the weekend I saw somebody browsing the web with a N800 in the  <a href="http://www.nightvisions.info/">Night Visions film festival</a>, this being the first time I see somebody I don't know just using the device in public.
