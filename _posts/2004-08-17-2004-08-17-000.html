To make implementing UTF-8 in Midgard easier in the mean while, Torben Nehmer has posted a handy <a href="http://www.nathan-syntronics.de/midgard/midcom/utf8.html" title="Guide for implementing UTF-8 with MidCOM and Midgard CMS">UTF-8 with MidCOM guide</a>.<br /><br />More information about internationalization in Midgard can be found from <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/concepts/i18n/" title="Midgard Documentation on Internationalization">Midgard Documentation</a>.<br /><br />Of course, even after Unicode is the default encoding in Midgard we will have to go through many MidCOM components to ensure they conform to test suites like Sam Ruby's <a title="Unicode test suite for Atom aggregators" href="http://www.intertwingly.net/stories/2004/06/02/i18n.atom">Atom Unicode test</a>. There are now problems like MidCOM <a href="http://midcom.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=78" title="Bug 78 in MidCOM bug tracker">bug #78 reports</a>.<br />
