The [Mac OS X packages of Midgard][1] made by [Robert Guerra][2] were [released][3] on August 15th. Since then it has been listed by both [VersionTracker][4] and [Download Squad][5]. Six hundred people have already downloaded the 500 meg disk image containing both [Midgard CMS 1.7][6] and [Fink][7].

This is very good start for introducing Midgard to the Mac world, especially as the installer is so smooth:

The obvious next step will be to [complete the Fink packaging][8] so that the installer will be smaller and fit right together with the regular Fink installation.

I can really recommend [OS X][9] users to try the packages out. The installation experience is even nicer than with Jarkko's [excellent Fedora packages][10]. Once the installer has been run, simply create a site with the [Site Wizard][11] and start entering your content.

> The real news is that they finally released a slick OS X installer for Midgard. In case you've never heard of it, Midgard is a great (open source) CMS that runs on Linux, or many UNIX systems. The OS X installer is brand new, so expect some potential bugs. Midgard boasts a feature set you'd expect from any decent CMS: web-based authoring, image asset management, clean URL's, roll-back, and a built-in search engine. Midgard only recently came to OS X and I'm glad they finally released an easy installer.

__Updated 2005-08-22:__ Updated download count from 300 to 600.
