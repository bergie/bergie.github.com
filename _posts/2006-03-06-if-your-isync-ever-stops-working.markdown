Every now and then [iSync][2] simply stops working. Apart from the [other problems][1], I'm seeing a lot of "_Unable to connect_".

If you get this error message, try if your Bluetooth connection to the mobile phone works otherwise. If it does, then the way to fix iSync is to reboot the Mac.

Maybe [Apple][3] should stop devising new ways to lock their customers into [.Mac][5] and make synchronization just work?

__In the other news,__ there is a [bus strike][4] now in Helsinki. Traffic is a scary combination of lots of snow and people who usually don't drive.
