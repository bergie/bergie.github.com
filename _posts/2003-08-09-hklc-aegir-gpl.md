Linux Center (HK) Ltd. has moved the popular Nadmin Studio content management product and its successor, Aegir CMS under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
The GPL licensing provides users rights to use, modify and distribute the software as long as the source code is kept available and modifications to the application given back to the development community. The licensing change also removes restrictions on providing commercial services on the CMS platform, allowing more companies to enter the market.

Nadmin Studio was a popular Content Management System originally developed by HKLC for small and mid-sized websites and organizations. In late 2002 Nadmin Studio was renamed to Aegir CMS and moved to the maintenance of an international developer community.

Aegir CMS runs on top of the Midgard Content Management Framework built on the Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) platform. Midgard powers thousands of websites ranging from small organizational websites ([www.luottokunta.fi](http://www.luottokunta.fi/)) to major portals like New Zealand eGovernment site ([www.govt.nz](http://www.govt.nz)) and Playbill ([www.playbill.com](http://www.playbill.com)).
