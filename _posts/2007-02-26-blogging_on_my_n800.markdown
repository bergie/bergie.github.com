 I'm posting this with the Maemo Blog application. We had a lunch with Santtu who wrote it, and I tried to demo how it doesn't work with my blog. And suddenly it did! Reverse demo effect ;-)

 The N800 is integrating more and more with my digital life - I listen to podcasts on it while commuting, it automatically positions me on Plazes when I pass familiar WiFi hotspots, I am almost as available on Jabber as on SMS, and my 3G provider must love me...
