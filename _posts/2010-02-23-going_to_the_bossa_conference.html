<p><a href="http://www.bossaconference.indt.org/">Bossa Conference</a>, an event about mobile development with free software technologies will be held on March 7th-10th in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus">Manaus</a>, Brazil. This year I'm speaking about using <a href="http://midgard2.org/">Midgard</a> as a replicated storage layer in mobile applications, with examples for multiple programming languages and toolkits.</p>
<p>The idea behind the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard2_stable-generic_content_repository_for_web-desktop_and_mobile/">Midgard content repository</a> is that instead of coming up with your own file formats you can just <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application/">keep working with objects and signals</a>, and let the repository deal with the rest.</p>

<p>It is always fun to go to Brazil and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/collections/72157600946258420/">meet the vibrant free software community</a> there. The plan is to fly over this weekend, spend a few days in Sao Paulo and then head for the Amazon. Feel free to <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/">ping me</a> if you're around.</p>
