<P ALIGN=left>The first travel day has been busy with preparations, as we had to build first version of the travel portal, and manage all practical issues for the trip.</P>
<P ALIGN=left>We have agreed to meet at the Tallink ferry terminal at 4pm, although Rambo already managed to forget that and tried to book that time for arriving to office.</P>
<P ALIGN=left>This will be the last journal entry before the trip. Hopefully our telecommunications will work even after the departure.</P>
