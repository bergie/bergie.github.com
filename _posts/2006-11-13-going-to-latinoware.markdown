I will be flying to [Foz do Iguacu][1] tomorrow for the [LatinoWare 2006 conference][2]. My talk on [Digital Business Ecosystem][3] is scheduled at 2pm on thursday the 16th.

As I've already given two [earlier talks][4] on DBE in Brazil, I will this time skip most [of the politics][4] and focus on how DBE can make everybody in the business of free software happier.

__In the other news,__ [here][5] is the first look at the new version of the [Maemo application catalog][6]:

Notable changes include switching to a more easily browse-able format from the old giant wiki page, using the new [single-click install][7] format and automatically linking all wiki pages tagged with application's name to the application page.

__Updated 2006-11-15:__ My talk [has been rescheduled][8] to 3pm.
