<blockquote>Here is the prediction then: within ten years, every major cloud service will be implemented in JavaScript. Even the Microsoft ones. JavaScript will be the essential item in every senior software engineerâ€™s skill set. Not only will it be the premier language for corporate systems, JavaScript will also dominate mobile devices. Not just phones, but tablets, and whatever enters that device category. All the while, JavaScript will continue to be the one and only language for developing complex interactive websites, completing drowning out old stalwarts such as Flash, even for games. For the first time in a history, a truly homogeneous programming language infrastructure will develop, with the same toolkits and libraries used from the top to the bottom of the technology stack. JavaScript everywhere.</blockquote>&#8212;Richard Rodger, on <strong><a href="http://www.richardrodger.com/2011/04/05/the-javascript-disruption/">JavaScript disruption</a></strong>.
