<blockquote>&quot;Motorcycling is a great hobby of mine. I ride all my life and I owned
different bikes and I ended with big kawasaki ninja. This motorbike has
matured 147 horse powers, some serious bark, it is that fast like a
bullet and comfortable for a long trips. I travel a lot and my favorite
destination lead through so called Chernobyl &quot;dead zone&quot; It is 130kms
from my home. Why favourite? because one can ride there for hours and
not meet any single car and not to see any single soul. People left and
nature is blooming, there are beautiful places, woods, lakes. Roads
haven't been built or repaired since 80th but in places where they
haven't been ridden by trucks or army technics, they stay in the same
condition as 20 years ago. Time do not ruin roads.&quot;</blockquote>

It would be interesting to meet some local bikers on the trip there next July. Visiting <a href="http://www.world66.com/europe/ukraine/chernobyl">Pripyat</a> also has some appeal...<br /></p>
