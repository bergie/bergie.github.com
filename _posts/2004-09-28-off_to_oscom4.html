Today will be filled with arrangement practicalities, and the actual conference starts tomorrow at 9:15 am. 
</p><p>
 All the previous <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/">OSCOM events</a> I've attended have been fun, and I'm expecting an interesting three days filled with discussion, new CMS ideas, and quite a few <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/program/" title="OSCOM 4 program">presentations</a>.

Despite the early departure the flights went without incident, and I had time to read some new RFPs and get started on the time-based release plan mRFC for <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a>. I was online in the <a href="http://www.wyona.com/">Wyona</a> office already before 11am.

<p>
Today was spent mostly by writing a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wiki</a> component, net.nemein.wiki for MidCOM. It will be used as a collective notepad by both OSCOM 4 and <a href="http://www.linuxgreenhouse.org/">Linux Greenhouse</a> people in upcoming events. So far the Wiki is very simplistic but should still fit the requirements. <a href="http://www.oscom.org/wiki/">OSCOM's Wiki</a> is already online.

I will be staying during the conference in <a href="http://www.wyona.com/people/michael-wechner/">Michi's</a> place. This place is becoming a geek camp with more than five more people staying here after tomorrow. Now I'm trying to follow a Spanish conversation about <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/lenya/">Apache Lenya</a> and <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/skins">CSS naming conventions</a>.
