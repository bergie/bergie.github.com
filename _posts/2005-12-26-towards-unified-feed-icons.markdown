Seems like the [RSS/Atom syndication][1] world is finally [uniting][4] around a [common feed icon][2], the [Mozilla one][3].

This should help to make the "[World Live Web][5]" less confusing to users. Some [One Click Subscription][6] magic will still be needed, but things are at least moving to a better direction. 

I like the way [Safari][7] handles the [default feed reader][8] selection, too.
