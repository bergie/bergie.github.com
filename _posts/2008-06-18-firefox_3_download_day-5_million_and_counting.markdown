The <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/firefox_3-soon/">Firefox 3 Download Day</a> started yesterday at 18:16 UTC, and so there are still 10 hours remaining to <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/?p=downloadday">download the browser</a>. Originally the download day had 1.5 million download pledges, but it seems that since then the download count has by far exceeded the expectations of the Mozilla team: at moment <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">the download counter</a> shows over five million downloads. The <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/faq">Download Day</a> has also been <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=388">prominently featured in news</a> worldwide.
