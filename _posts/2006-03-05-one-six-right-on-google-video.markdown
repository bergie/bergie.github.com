[One Six Right][1], the documentary about the [Van Nuys][2] [General Aviation][3] airport in Los Angeles is [available on Google Video][4] (__Updated: not available__)

The documentary tells the story of this historic airport well, and outlines how important general aviation is to the whole aviation industry. It also shows several beautiful historic airplanes flying from Van Nuys.

Something similar could help the other [historic][7] and [endangered][8] airport, [Helsinki-Malmi][5]. The [MIK videos][6] are of course a good start.

Just watching the video makes me really want to go flying again. Luckily the weather is improving all the time.

__Updated 2006-03-22:__ Seems that the movie isn't available any more. For some reason I'm getting nasty lawyer letters about this blog post...
