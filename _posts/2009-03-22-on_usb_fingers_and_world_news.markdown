Week and half ago I posted <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/when_reality_meets_product_concepts/">a story on Jerry's USB finger</a>. While obviously we all thought the idea of <a href="http://protoblogr.net/blog/view/usb_finger-more_details.html">replacing a lost finger with USB storage</a> was cool in a cyberpunk way, we still felt it was old news as all had happened around last summer. And so, the worldwide interest around it took us by quite a surprise. The story was an all major news websites, and even on radio morning shows.

The wave of attention, as shown by Google Analytics fits <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/salimismail/91817897/">Morgan Stanley's media coverage graph</a> reasonably well:

</p><p>
First the story was picked up by <a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/Severed_Finger_Replaced_with_USB_Linux_Distro">Digg</a>, then gadget sites <a href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5167612/the-usb-finger-drive-is-real-and-as-gross-as-we-imagined">Gizmodo</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/10/usb-finger-drive-concept-attempts-to-keep-up-with-reality/">Engadget</a>. Second attention peak came from <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/13/1520240">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2009/03/16/man-replaces-lost-fi.html">Boing Boing</a>, and after that there was the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&amp;ncl=1315154573">long tail of mainstream media</a> followed by smaller local newspapers and websites:

A week after the post <a href="http://protoblogr.net/">Jerry</a> was visiting our office to do integration testing for a project and the media circus was running at its hottest. His phone, and even mine were ringing quite often, with interview requests ranging from Indian radio stations to <em>Channel 4 New</em>s and <em>Reuters</em>. Will be interesting to see how much longer the attention stays on when the story hits the TV networks next week.

Never underestimate what <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/when_reality_meets_product_concepts/">a single blog</a> post <a href="http://marcin.soltysiak.com/c1b6f560146511debe8151f5a40d51375137/">can initiate</a>!
