Midgard Weekly Summaries resurrected
------------------------------------

Welcome to the first issue of the [resurrected Midgard Weekly Summaries][1]! The [66 issues][6] released before this were edited by [Henri Bergius][5] and [Ken Pooley][4] between 1999 and 2002, after which MWS went on hiatus.

The new MWS editions are edited collaboratively to make the editing burden easier. To suggest stories here bookmark them with [del.icio.us tag "midgardweeklysummary"][2]. Screenshots may also be suggested by tagging them with ["midgardweeklysummary" on Flickr][3].

Happenings this week
--------------------

* New community server. Midgard's old project server which has been hosted by Nehmer.net has started to get old, and in response a new server has been bought for the project. Midgard's project site should go live on the new server some time during the weekend. The new server is sponsored by [Nemein][18], [Anykey][16] and [Ware.it][17].

* Hungarian translations for Midgard. András Lévai has started translating Midgard's user interfaces to the [Hungarian language][10]. Currently core components are 28% translated and other components 21% translated.

* Maemo Blog compatible with Midgard. [Maemo Blog][8] is a mobile blogging application for [Nokia's internet tablets][9]. Maemo Blog's developer [Santtu Lakkala][7] has tested compatibility with Midgard. When completed, Maemo Blog will be an advanced travel blogging tool in the sense that it can communicate the user's geographical location to Midgard with the MetaWeblog API calls.

* Flickr photo import. Midgard's photo management component is now [able to import user's photos][11] from the [Flickr photo sharing service][12]. This enables easy moblogging by using tools like [Nokia Lifeblog][13] to post pictures on Flickr and then having Midgard automatically import them from there.

* Vote Midgard for the 2007 Open Source CMS summit. Henri Bergius has proposed session [Manage your personal information space with Midgard][14] to the conference. [The event][15] will be held on March 22nd and 23rd in Sunnyvale, California. If you're interested in hearing how Midgard integrates with the various social web services out there, go and vote for the proposal.
