We wanted to make the [beta][6] release of [OpenPsa2][1] this week. However, there are two
issues preventing this for now:

* OpenPsa2 under [Midgard 1.7.3][2] causes strange [SIGABORTs][5] in Apache when saving data
* [Installation][4] is currently quite involved process

As to the installation part of this, you all can help by commenting the new packaging proposal in [mRFC 0021][3].

And if you want to install it anyway, read the [OpenPsa 2 installation instructions][4].
