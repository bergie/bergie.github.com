<a href="http://www.greywolves.org/">Harmaasudet</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_history">living history</a> group we started in <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004-04-04-000/">mid-90s</a>, and the reason why I originally got into software, recently migrated back into <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard/">the Midgard platform</a>.

Their webmaster and <a href="http://nemein.com/">Nemein</a> alumnus <a href="http://nettiapina.fi/blog/">Heikki</a> asked me for <a href="http://nettiapina.fi/blog/2008/10/29/greywolvesorg-goes-back-to-roots/">some history of Midgard</a>, and this is what I wrote:
</p><blockquote>
Well, original Midgard was completely programmed in order to run the Grey Wolves site. We hacked it together with <a href="http://jukkaz.wordpress.com/">@jlz</a> in Helsinki Capital of Culture offices in Etelaranta at night time.
<br /><br />Before Midgard, the site had run on a SGML pipelines -based publishing system we called SusiSGML, and member registry on some custom Perl stuff. Then we wanted more dynamic functionality, and Midgard was born. At first @jlz was intending to write it in Scheme, but then chose the C+PHP extension.
<br /><br />For administration, we wrote the “Midgard Admin” tool, traces of which can still be seen in SpiderAdmin.
<br /><br />Midgard was intended to be a one-off, but then as my employer Stonesoft clearly needed some system I deployed there. Then @jlz was hired to my team, and we decided to open source Midgard before any IPR issues would rise with our employer, which was after all a proprietary software vendor.
<br /><br />When the original Midgard-based Grey Wolves site launched in early 99, we had the great example of what things can be: Hiiden Hirven Hiihto photos and reportage were live only couple of hours after the event ended. And this was before we had digital cameras…

<a href="http://jukkaz.wordpress.com/">Jukka Zitting</a>, the original Midgard lead developer also <a href="http://jukkaz.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/flashback-susisgml-midgard-and-cocoon/">added some points</a>:
</p><blockquote>
Architecturally SusiSGML was pretty much like early versions of <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Apache Cocoon</a>, only with SGML and DSSSL instead of <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL</a>. Had we been at it a few years later, Midgard might have been based on Cocoon. :-)

The Midgard project <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/1999050701705NWSW">will turn 10 years old</a> next May, and so it is great time to collect some odd bits and pieces of <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/midgard-release-names/">Midgard folklore</a>.
