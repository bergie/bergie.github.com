[Arttu][1] and others at the office are now [tuning the Midgard UI][2] with these goals

* Support the new features of MidCOM 2.5
* Be more visible to the users
* Add support for [contextual help][3]

Some [examples][5] of the first, Firefox-only toolbar are [now available][4]. I tested them on a [Nokia 770][6], and they seem to be working just fine:

This is promising as I definitely want to be able to manage my websites using the small internet tablet.
