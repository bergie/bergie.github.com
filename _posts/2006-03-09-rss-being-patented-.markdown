Looks like [Apple][1] is trying to patent [RSS feeds][2] and [RSS auto-discovery][3]:

> Techniques for detecting, managing, and presenting syndication XML (feeds) are disclosed. In one embodiment, a web browser automatically determines that a web site is publishing feeds and notifies the user, who can then access the feed easily. In another embodiment, a browser determines that a web page or feed is advertising relationship XML, and displays information about the people identified in the relationship XML. In yet another embodiment, a browser determines that a file contains a feed and enables the user to view it in a user-friendly way. In yet another embodiment, feed state information is stored in a repository that is accessible by applications that are used to view the feed. In yet another embodiment, if a feed's state changes, an application notifies the repository, and the state is updated. In yet another embodiment, a feed is parsed and stored in a structured way.

Now, the [RSS format][5] and feed readers have been around for quite a while. I remember generating feeds in RSS precursor [Channel Definition Format][6] for consumption by [Microsoft Active Desktop][7] around 1997 or 1998. The Apple patent applications are from January 2005 so there is quite obvious [prior art][8].

Apple started doing silly things with RSS with the [PhotoCast mess][9] and this is a quite logical continuation.

Via [Miguel de Icaza][4].
