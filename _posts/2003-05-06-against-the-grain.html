<p>Preparatory posting for OSCOM 3 regarding inter-CMS cooperation.
</p>

<a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/">Gregor J. Rothfuss</a> and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/">Paul Everitt</a> have posted an interesting article titled "<a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/657.html">Against the Grain: Getting Projects To Work Together</a>" on Advogato.<br />
<br />
The article deals with practical and social problems of getting different Open Source projects to interoperate and support common standards. Open source projects don't work together nearly as often as the availability of the source code would suggest. Cultural differences between projects, egoes, and many other issues stand in the way.<br />
<br />
This topic is very relevant to the upcoming <a href="http://www.oscom.org/Conferences/Cambridge/">OSCOM 3</a> conference. During the conference different Open Source CMSs, Midgard included, will participate in <a href="http://www.oscom.org/Conferences/Cambridge/Program/workshops.html">interop workshops</a> and discuss common themes like <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a>, <a href="http://www.nitf.org/">NITF</a>, <a href="http://www.oscom.org/Projects/Twingle/">Twingle</a> and <a href="http://slideml.bitflux.ch/">SlideML</a>.
