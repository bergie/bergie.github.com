Problems with "parselinks.sh"

It really seems, that I soon will have to revise the program that finds correct links for different web pages at Tyr. The reason is just that it somehow doesn't accept index.shtml-files as correct files, and thus takes wrong links for them. Also, it has been hardcoded, and so works currently with only the Tyr test site :-(

I think I'll still keep my [own site](https://bergie.iki.fi) and the [LRPring site](http://web.archive.org/web/20010217114818/http://bergie.greywolves.org/lrpring) under SSI for a while.
