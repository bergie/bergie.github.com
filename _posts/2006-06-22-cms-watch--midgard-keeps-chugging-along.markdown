Tony Byrne from [CMS Watch][1] noted the [recent advances in Midgard][2] based on yesterday's [1.7.6 release][3]:

> The [latest release][3] (1.7.6, in case you're counting) builds on some previous attempts to make the package play better in standard corporate environments, including integration with Apache Lucene for search, and [JSR-170][4] support as well.

I agree with Tony that the recent changes like better [third-party authentication][5] make Midgard fit well in corporate networks.

His other comments are also interesting, noting the [base of activity][6] in the project:

> The open-source CMS package [Midgard][7] is not very popular in North America, but it sports a wide following in Central and Eastern Europe, including a core group of developers who have slowly re-architected the package after a semi-dormant period early in the decade.

Great to see that CMS Watch is still actively monitoring [Midgard][7]. Their site has been [running on it][8] for quite a while, I believe they haven't seen much of the more modern Midgard features like [MidCOM components][11], [PEAR packaging][10] or the [AJAX UI][9]. Hopefully these become more visible once [1.8][12] hits stable.
