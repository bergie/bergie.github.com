<br />From <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/when_reality_meets_product_concepts/">USB fingers</a> and <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5173389/terrafugia-flying-car-makes-first-flight">flying cars</a> to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1165416/Chinas-hi-tech-death-van-criminals-executed-organs-sold-black-market.html?ITO=1490">Chinese death vans</a>, I think we need to agree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">the future</a> is now. It is just not (thankfully) <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson#Attributed">evenly distributed</a>.
