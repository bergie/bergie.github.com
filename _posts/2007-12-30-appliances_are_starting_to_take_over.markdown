There was <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/29/1959244">some discussion on Amazon's listings</a> on Slashdot. As I've noted <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004-04-13-001.html">every year has recently been predicted</a> as the one when Linux desktop takes over I thought <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=401492&amp;cid=21851200">this comment</a> particularly insightful:

<blockquote>Now, the &quot;Linux Desktop&quot; fantasists can finally let it go. There will be no &quot;year of the Linux desktop&quot;, just as there will be no &quot;year of the Linux mainframe&quot;.<br /><br />

...<br /><br />

Pushing for a change in the desktop from Windows to Mac or Linux is, in 10 years, going to seem like striving to continue the VMS vs Unix wars on the VAX platform.<br /><br />

What 2008, 2009, and 2010 are going to be are the &quot;years where appliances took over half the desktop functions&quot; - you still want a big monitor and ergo keyboard to Photoshop, do development of web pages and code, and so on. But people sitting right at their desktop will whip out their paperback-sized appliance to do E-mail and chat, because that's where their communication apps live.<br /><br />

And, yes, those new appliances will mostly run Linux. What else?</blockquote>As I've seen the nice, new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N810">N810 internet tablet</a> take over more and more roles from <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/switching-to-intel-macbook.html">my MacBook</a> I can only agree.<span style="font-size:10pt;"></span><p style="text-align:right;"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Technorati Tags: </span><span style="font-size:10pt;"><a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/maemo">maemo</a></span><span style="font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-size:10pt;"><a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/linux">linux</a></span></p>
