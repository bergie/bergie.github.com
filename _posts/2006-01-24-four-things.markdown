I'm giving over for the [latest blog meme][26] while waiting for a connection to the local Midgard server here. For some reason the firewall blocks pretty much everything...

So here are the _Four Things_:

## Four jobs I’ve had in my life

I could summarize it like [Nathan Pitman][25] to _Web developer, Web developer, Web developer, ..._ I'm into IT in the third generation and so somehow avoided the standard entry-level [McJobs][30].

- IT class administrator at _Nimad_, my father's company
- Web designer at _HyperHouse_, a new media company
- Project manager at [Stonesoft][27], a security software company
- Entrepreneur at [Nemein][28], a content management vendor

## Four movies I can watch over and over

I don't tend to watch movies more than once or twice, but these four stand out of the group:

- [Porco Rosso][10]
- [Blade Runner][11]
- [Monty Python and the Holy Grail][19]
- I've also seen [Braveheart][17] at least a gazillion times in the [Viking period][18]


## Four places I have lived

I've actually lived in only three different cities, but I guess the summer cottage can be counted as fourth, as I spent lots of time there when I was a kid:

- Helsinki, Finland
- Kirkkonummi, Finland
- Espoo, Finland
- Sulkava, in the lake region of Finland

## Four TV shows I love to watch

I don't watch TV anymore, but back in late 90's when I was living in a commune apartment, we used to watch:

- Babylon 5
- Dawson's Creek
- Earthworm Jim

## Four places I have been on vacation

My holiday trips tend to take me on the road to quite different kinds of places. Usually I travel by [my motorbike][8] or, in near future, [a Honda Monkey][9]

- [Tbilisi, Georgia][20]
- [Murmansk, Russia][22]
- [Pristina, Kosovo][21]
- [Sani Pass, Lesotho][23]

## Four of my favourite dishes

I'm really into oriental dishes, and also food made out of basic ingredients like dried meat:

- Sushi, especially salmon and roe
- [Khinkali][24]
- Thai noodles
- [Biltong][29]


## Four websites I visit daily

I guess this means the sites I _really_ visit, instead of just reading them with my [RSS reader][14]:

- [Google][12]
- [Midgard Project][13]
- [Sinfest][15]
- [Viivi & Wagner][16]


## Four places I would rather be right now


Hey, I'm in South Africa and it is 24°C outside, so why complain?

Via [Drew McLellan][1] and [Visa Kopu][2].

__In the other news,__ I'm now in [Cape Town][3], South Africa. I'll spend the next two weeks here working on [IDASA's][4] new _Word on the Street Portal_ for journalists covering local government. The project is funded by [Finnish Foreign Ministry][5] and coordinated by the [City of Tampere][6].

Connectivity here in the office is quite slow, and allows only proxied HTTP, so I won't be able to be on IRC or access my mail too often. I'll have to see if the [Townhouse hotel][7] connection is less restricted.

__Updated 2006-01-25:__ The four things meme [is quite popular][31]. According to Google Blog Search there are over 19,000 blog postings about it already.

And the connection problems are clear now: we have hear a 128 Mb DSL line that is shared with 100 users.
