Summer holiday is now over, and as [Tigert put it][1], we [made it to Gibraltar][2].

![Skyteam Monkeys in front of Gibraltar](/files/monkeys-and-the-gibraltar-rock.jpg)

In addition to showing the beautiful European countryside from a _worm's eye perspective_ of a slow-moving and [small vehicle][3], the trip was also an excellent field test for [Midgard's][5] new [positioning services][4], and for [mobile blogging][8] using the new Nokia [N][6] and [E][7] series phones.

All in all, a very interesting trip.

Now that I'm back on duty, the things I will focus on next are:

* [Getting MultiLingual Midgard forward][9]
* [Rewriting Midgard's replication system][10]
* Developing an order management system into [OpenPsa 2][11]
* Adding the missing pieces into Midgard's [new AJAX UI][14] with [Jerry][15]
* ...and finally, helping [Tarjei][13] along in his role as the [new MidCOM maintainer][12]

In addition, Kerttu just bought me a bicycle which I will be able to test on the monday commute. Will be interesting as the last time I've had a bike was some fifteen years ago...
