Last morning in St. Petersburg. We're packing and wondering how Kerttu will get all her stuff carried without the motorcycle.

<p>
Departure. Shared farewell kvas with Kerttu on Palace bridge, and now headed to Kupchino to return keys. Then on towards Moscow on M10.

First gas stop about 40km from St. Petersburg. Slight drizzle but sky looks clear ahead. Odometer says 56615km.

<p>
Slightly past Veliky Novgorod. Some of the potholes are big enough to eat a motorcycle.

Tver on river Volga. Hotel Tsentralnaya is familiar from last summer's trip. Next task is to find a stoyanka, then food and a pivo.

<p>
It does give slight  bad horror movie flashbacks when the room behind a long dark corridor has a faucet that spurts out red liquid and no light

After some shashlik and pivo on the riverbank and journal writing it is time to call it a day. Tomorrow is a long ride ahead.

<p>
Morning blinis and coffee in Tver's Olimp shopping center while some photos are printed. Looks like I'll skip Moscow to get to Black Sea faster.

<p>
No working ATMs in whole Tver so I'll just start the engines. From now on everything will be unknown territory.

The stoyanka guys had played me the trick of emptying my tank. Oh well, gas is cheap here. I really need a lockable gas cap.

<p>
I just crossed a railway intersection closed for repairs motocross style near M1. Drivers of stuck cars cheered me on. :-)

<p>
Olitsvino. Headed south on Moscow ring road in quite bad traffic. Crossed river Moskva and saw signs to Kiev and Astrakhan. Difficult choise?

<p>
My Digital Ixus has seen too much dust and potholes, and decided to die. I have to dismantle it. In meanwhile, I'll try to get a film camera.

<p>
Pelmeni break in Detchino. Headed southwest on M3 with some rain clouds ahead. Still 240 km to Bryansk.

<p>
Passing a truck in front of a militsia checkpoint set me back with 300rub. Now I'm out of rubles. Hopefully Bryansk has an ATM.

Bryansk. Finding a bankomat was easy. Next is the familiar drill of seeking accomodation, stoyanka and food. Today's ride was about 560km

<p>
Found a nice room from hotel Desna. What worries me though is that the bike will be guarded only by statue of Lenin and two locks. No stoyankas.

This morning there was a cute grey kitten sleeping under my bike. Visit to post office and it is time to go. About 200km to the Ukrainian border

Not only I have to watch out for crazy trucks and check points, but also for herds of geese on the road. Very beautiful green scenery, though.
