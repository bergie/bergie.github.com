[Ben Hammersley has gone to the iWeb side][1], making his blog image-only. [Some][11] [commentation][10] is [available][2]:

> Why not publish in PDF if you’re going to go against the web’s grain anyway? That gets you frictionless publishing tools.

[iWeb][3] is Apple's new "[every man's publishing tool][8]" that seems to lean back to the web of the late nineties. Text is images, URLs are horrible and [the HTML is messy][7].

The way I noticed Ben's change was that his feed became almost impossible to read in [NetNewsWire][4], causing me to unsubscribe:

Come on, Apple! First the [iCal .Mac synchronization lock-in][6], then the [PhotoCast mess][5], and now this. It makes me wonder if anybody at Apple gets the web at all...

At least there is a [Greasemonkey plugin][9] for making iWeb pages readable in case you ever need that.
