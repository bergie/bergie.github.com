[Maemo][1], the open source mobile device platform developed by [Nokia][2] is switching its web infrastructure to [Midgard CMS][3]. [Ferenc Szekely writes][4]:

> We have conducted a study on migrating/integrating all existing services
of maemo.org with the [Midgard CMS][3] framework. Based on the study we
have decided to go ahead and setup the new environment.

> The highlights of the project are:

> 
- centralized account management using Garage
- on-line documentation authoring using Midgard
- proper and robust access control
- automated API generating/publishing
- database based Application Catalogue ;)

[Nemein][5] is participating in [the project][6] as the Midgard expert organization.

__Updated 2006-10-26:__ The project is now well under way. The [Midgard layout templates][7] for Maemo and [original specifications][8] are available.

__Updated 2006-10-29:__ [Tuomas Kuosmanen][10] has a good [summary of the project][9] too.
