<blockquote style="">Before Henry Ford unleashed the practice of mass production on the world, every little town had a few dozen artisans who made the lives of citizens easier. A cobbler made the shoes, a tailor sewed suits and a carpenter built furniture. Mass production sounded the death knell for many specialist craft jobs, and the rise of computerised supply chains finished off most of the rest. But now, a century later, the trend is reversing itself. The new craftsmen do not stitch leather, cut cloth or saw wood: instead, they write software. </blockquote><p>Via <a href="http://ranchero.com/2004/03/15.php">Ranchero Software</a>.</p>

This was also a central theme in Eric Raymond's <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>.</p>
