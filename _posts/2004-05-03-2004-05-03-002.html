We discussed this trend some days ago with <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/whoswho/torben.html">Torben</a>, and came up with several points:<br /><ul><li>Midgard 1.x is starting to show age. The <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/framework/">framework</a> was designed back in 1998</li><li>Code quality in <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/download/1.6.0.html">1.6.0 alphas</a> and in some major modules like <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/aegir/">Aegir</a> is really bad</li><li><a href="http://www.oscom.org/matrix/index.html">The competition</a> is getting tougher</li><li>Installation is still horribly difficult<br /></li></ul>However, even despite of these, we decided there is no reason to get too alarmed. In experienced hands, Midgard 1.x is still fairly competitive, and the work being done on <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/2004-04-28-000.html">Midgard 2.x</a> and <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/mrfc/0005.html">MidCOM 2</a> is promising, especially with the <a href="http://europa.eu.int/">EU</a> support. The recent <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/mrfc/0003.html">focus on usability</a> should also help.<br /><br />Also, if we get 1.6.0 stabilized in this weekend's <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/2004-03-25-000.html">Poznan meeting</a>, things should look a lot brighter, with bunch of new things:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://midgard.tigris.org/source/browse/midgard/src/httpd/apache2/">Apache 2.x</a> support<br /></li><li>Integrated <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/2004-03-22-000.html">PAM authentication</a> support</li><li><a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/2003-11-27-000.html">UTF-8</a> as default encoding</li><li><a href="http://midgard.dataflow.ch/doc.html">Multilingual content</a> support by default</li><li><a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/">MidCOM</a> and <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/aegir/">Aegir</a> bundled as default</li><li><a href="http://midgard.tigris.org/source/browse/midgard/src/tools/datagard/">Datagard</a>, the new database installer</li></ul>Of course, it should be noted that SecuritySpace survey isn't the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/framework/usage">whole truth</a> on CMS market shares. (thanks for reminder, <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/whoswho/ab.html">Alexander</a>!)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 13:30:</span> <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/whoswho/tarjei.html">Tarjei</a> gave his list of issues:<br /><ul><li>There are <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/2003-04-09-002.html">too many administrative user interfaces</a>, but they all share the same weaknesses. Solutions could be:<br /></li><ul><li>Unify the UIs to Aegir 2 and MidCOM 2</li><li>Add <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a> support to make development more file-based</li></ul><li>Aegir* and Nemein* libraries are too hard to access, making it difficult to build on top of them. Solution:</li><ul><li>Start using <a href="http://www.phpdoc.de/">PHPdoc</a> for documenting the libraries and get an unified backend OO framework</li><li>Demand <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php">PEAR coding standards</a><br /></li></ul><li>Midgard does not support <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/mrfc/0002.html">read-level access controls</a></li><li>Midgard must get closer to the <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> and PHP communities</li><li>Midgard lacks a package format that would enable deleting packages<br /></li></ul>
