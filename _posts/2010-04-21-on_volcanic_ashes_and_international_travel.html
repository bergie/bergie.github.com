<p>The past two weeks have been pretty hectic for me - <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/go/6myd/">Midgard Gathering</a> in Poland, some meetings in Berlin, and the <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit">Linux Collaboration Summit</a> in San Francisco. And then, thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallaj√∂kull eruption</a> in Iceland and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel_disruption_after_the_2010_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull_eruption">resulting flight cancellations</a>, the trip back became a little bit more complicated.</p>

<p>My original KLM flight on April 17th was cancelled, and as the best offer from the airline was to get me home on 27th I made some quick decisions while still on the San Francisco airport. As it was certain that there would be some days of delay, New York felt like the best place to wait for <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/aviation/vaac/data/VAG_1271763280.png">the dust</a> to settle.</p>

<p>After a failed attempt to get across the Atlantic on an Indian airline, my current plan is to fly tonight to Moscow with Aeroflot, and then hopefully to continue to Helsinki from there, either by plane or train.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, thanks to Gregor and Google for graciously providing me with office space while I'm stuck here!</p>

<p><strong>As an afterthought:</strong> if such disruptions in flying would continue, that would be a huge boost for high-speed rail, fast ocean liners and telepresence. And that might not be such a bad thing for the future of mankind.</p>
