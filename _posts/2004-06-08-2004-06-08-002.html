<blockquote>
Here is your chance to let our project team members know who you are and which challenges you encounter when working with or using web standards.
</blockquote>

<p>WaSP deals with the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/learn/faq/#p2">client side standards</a> of web, while <a href="http://www.oscom.org/">OSCOM</a> deals with the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/standards/">server side standards</a>. Both are important for building scalable, accessible and enduring web solutions.<br /></p>
<p>Bonus points to WaSP for providing <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/cms/">Midgard</a> as the second example of a content management system in the survey.<br /></p>
