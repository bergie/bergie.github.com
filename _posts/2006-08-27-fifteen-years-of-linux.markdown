Two days and fifteen years ago, [Linus Torvalds][3] posted [a message on comp.os.minix][1]:

> I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.  This has been brewing
since april, and is starting to get ready.  I'd like any feedback on
things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
(same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
among other things).

The operating system he was talking about became [Linux][2], a major operating system that now runs on everything from cell phones to supercomputers.

[Computer Science department][6] of the University of Helsinki (where [Linux was invented][7]), and the [Finnish Centre for Open Source Software][5] will be [celebrating the event][4] on September 4th.
