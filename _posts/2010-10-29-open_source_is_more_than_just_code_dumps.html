<p>Great quote from Matt Asay's analysis of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/28/symbian-a-lesson-on-the-wrong-way-to-use-open-source/">what went wrong with the opening of Symbian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Open source isn’t a one-time announcement, coupled with a code drop.   It’s exceptionally hard, ongoing work that requires equal parts  evangelism, programming, and customer success stories to keep developers  believing that their work matters.</blockquote>
<p>This is very much in line with what I <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/open_source-free_software-what_we_need_is_open_projects/">wrote about Open Projects</a> earlier. I'll be giving a talk on the subject in <a href="http://www.openmind.fi/ohjelma-ke">COSS's OpenMind conference on Nov 10th</a>.</p>
