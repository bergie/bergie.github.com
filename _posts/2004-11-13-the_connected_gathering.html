We're now in the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/events/2004-11-14-000.html">Midgard Gathering</a> in Link√∂ping. Since Sweden has been too far for many Midgard community members, we're trying to make the event as connected as possible.
</p><p>
So far it is possible to follow the event live from two web cams:
</p><p align="center"><img src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/roofcam.jpg" border="0" height="240" width="320" alt="roofcam.jpg" title="Roof camera snapshot" /></p><p>
The web cams are available <a href="http://webcam.anykey.se/view/view.shtml">here</a> and <a href="http://212.214.78.218/view/view.shtml">here</a>. To see the image log in as guest/guest.
</p><p>
In addition to the web cams, there are tons of photos from the event. Expect first ones to be posted to <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/gallery/">Midgard Gallery</a> later today.
We've also shot some interviews on video. The plan is to edit those on the drive back to Stockholm tomorrow and publish them soon.
</p><p>
As <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/whoswho/torben.html">Torben</a> wants to attend the meeting from Bavaria we're also thinking of rigging up a <a href="http://www.goteamspeak.com/news.php">TeamSpeak</a> system and we'll also be available on the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/support-discussion/">IRC channel</a>. Discussion is also available as <a href="http://ryt.nu:9000/midgard.ogg">IceCast broadcast</a>.
</p><p>
So most the event will be available for online participation. With the important exception of beer.
