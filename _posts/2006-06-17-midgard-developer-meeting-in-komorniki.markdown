[We][1] spent the last two days driving from Helsinki to [Poznan][3], Poland for the [Midgard Developer Meeting][2]. This proved to be a good field test for [Maemo 2.0][14] as we needed to instruct people back home about some project details using [Google Talk][15].

## Saturday

While the trip was a long one, it has definitely been worth it. So far we've covered the following:

* I presented the [Midgard Future Admin][5] AJAX user interface project we've been working on with [Incognito][4]
* Piotras told us about the new, cool [MidgardQueryBuilder features][6]
* I ported the [net.nemein.calendar component][7] into [MidCOM 2.5 technology][8] (while on the road, it is cool to have an [inverter][20] and [local Midgard install][19])
* [Midgard Site Wizard][9] was also ported to [MidCOM 2.5][8]
* We made a plan for [better _undelete_ functionality][10] and replication
* Rambo and Alessio have been looking at the [Red5 media streaming server][13] for Flash
* We [discussed][31] the [MidgardCollector proposal][32] which will eventually simplify parameter and ACL retrieval, and help with [caching][33]

## Sunday

We hit the old square of Poznan again on saturday night after watching the [Italy-USA game][21] with Alessio, and toured the local bars until about 4am.

We continued the meeting around 11am, have covered the following:

* Arttu held a [MidCOM component development][11] workshop, and Rambo and I explained the new MidCOM 2.5 features like [DBA][35], [ACL][34], [watchers][36], [cron][37] and [Datamanager 2][38]
* I added [quota support][22] into the [Midgard Site Wizard][9] and Midgard's new _About Midgard_ page
* Oskari added support for folder's attachments into the [MidCOM image pop-up][24]
* Joonas started to design a new login dialog for Midgard
* Juhana tried to set up the [jLibrary document manager][25] that we want to integrate with Midgard, but didn't quite get it working
* And most importantly, we acquired four boxes of Russian [sparkling wine][29], most of it for Osku's upcoming wedding, and some for [sabrage practice][30]
