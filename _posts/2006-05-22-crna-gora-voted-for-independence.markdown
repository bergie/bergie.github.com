[Montenegro][1] (Crna Gora in the [slavic languages][2]) [voted for independence][3] yesterday. Hopefully the split from [Serbia][4] happens peacefully.

I rode through the country on the way home from [my Black Sea motorcycle trip][5] in 2004, and it is a complete motorcyclists' paradise. Empty, curvy roads through breathtakingly beautiful mountains, gorges and passes. And all of it a short ferry trip away from Italy.

Entry to the country from UN-administered [Kosovo][6] was interesting. No entry stamps or such, as those might make further travel in Serbia difficult. In any case, Montenegro is definitely a place worth a visit.
