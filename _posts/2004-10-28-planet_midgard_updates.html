<p><a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/planet/">Planet Midgard</a> is the blog aggregator displaying what's going on in
the Midgard community.</p><p>
Planet Midgard is now running latest version of <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/reference/components/net.nemein.rss.html">net.nemein.rss</a> 
aggregator, meaning a bunch of new things:
</p><ul><li>Support for feeds in <a href="http://atomenabled.org/">Atom</a> format (previously we could aggregate
    only RSS feeds)</li><li>UTF-8 support, meaning that we can now aggregate blog postings
    in non-western characters (especially Russian seems to be popular
    in the Midgard community)</li><li>Hackergotchi support: if your feed has been marked to contain
    a "hacker head", it will be displayed together with your posts.
    See <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet GNOME</a> for a good example on this</li></ul><p>
So, with these updates I would like to call for two things:
</p><p><strong>First</strong> of all, if you're a member of the Midgard community (contributor
or active user), please get your blog aggregated on Planet Midgard.
If you already have a blog, just mail me the URL to your RSS or Atom
feed. 
</p><p>
And if you don't have a blog, please start one. Blogs are a great way to 
communicate your ideas and stuff you're working on.
</p><p>
It is very easy to start blogging, either just create a new
Midgard topic powered by the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/reference/components/de.linkm.newsticker.html">de.linkm.newsticker</a> component, or sign
up to one of the free services like <a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a> or <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>.
</p><p>
Note that we can also aggregate news releases from Midgard companies,
and blog postings in languages other than English. Planet Midgard
already aggregates <a href="http://siriux.net/">Nico's</a> posts in German, <a href="http://sideahead.blogspot.com/">Alexander's</a> posts in
Russian and <a href="http://walhi.blogspot.com/">WALHI's</a> posts in Indonesian.
</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, if you're already aggregated on Planet Midgard, please
make a hacker head image of yourself. This gives a face to your
posts, adding to the community feeling. If you see who is posting,
it is easier to feel it as a conversation:
</p><p align="center"><img src="https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/bergie-hackergotchi-planet-midgard.jpg" border="1" height="128" width="148" alt="bergie-hackergotchi-planet-midgard.jpg" align="" /></p><p>
The hacker head (or hackergotchi) is an approximately 65 pixel wide
and 85 pixel high transparent PNG image showing your face detached
from its surroundings and added with a drop shadow. See some examples
in <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/heads/">Planet GNOME</a>.
</p><p>
Once you have your hackergotchi image done, upload it somewhere and
mail me the link (you can also mail me the image itself).
</p><p>
If you don't have the necessary graphics skills, mail URL to image
you want to have it made from here and somebody will help you out.
</p><p><strong>BTW</strong>, for those with RSS aggregators (like <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>),
Planet Midgard is available at
  <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/planet/rss.xml">http://www.midgard-project.org/planet/rss.xml</a></p>

<p><strong>Updated 2004-12-14:</strong> Hackergotchis displayed on Planet Midgard are now displayed also on a separate <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/planet/heads/">collection page</a>.
