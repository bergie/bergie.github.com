During the winter there is no motorcycling to be had, and so I use public transportation. To get to and from urgent meetings I usually take a taxi. The taxis in Helsinki region are usually very nice and high-techy. The drivers use a moving map GPS systems for orienteering, and the taxis can be called via SMS.
</p><p>
The SMS ordering system is very nice because it bypasses the long queues in the taxi center and go directly to the cars. When a driver takes a job you get the an SMS notification with the car number. To order a taxi, send an SMS to number <strong>13170</strong> containing:
</p><p>
CITY STREET NUMBER, for example<br />
Espoo Sepetlahdentie 9
</p><p>
This is all very nice. However, today has not been a good taxi day.
</p><ul><li>The first cab driver of the day was visibly drunk, and the whole car stank of old booze</li><li>The second driver drove cheerfully past <a href="http://www.nemein.com/en/team/rambo.html">Rambo</a> and I when we were waiting on the parking lot, and kept driving away from us every time we walked towards it</li><li>...and finally, the third driver arrived 15 minutes late and needed constant advice to avoid getting lost in the city</li></ul><p>
Oh well, now on to the flight instrument training that is part of FCF's PPL(A) theory course.

I installed Nico's patch to my test server, and it works quite well although configuration interface is still missing. Thanks, Nico!
