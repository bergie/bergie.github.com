<p>At <a href="http://fosdem.org/2012/">FOSDEM 2012</a> we will have a <a href="http://fosdem.org/2012/devrooms_for_2012">devroom</a> related to <em>Open Mobile Linux</em>. Our primary goal is to facilitate meetups, collaboration and awareness between different projects and communities within Open Mobile Linux and provide a place to present directions, ideas and your projects themselves.<br /><br /> By Open Mobile Linux we mean any open source projects revolving around typical non-desktop/server Linux, such as handsets, tablets, netbooks or other creative uses. Examples of such projects could be <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt5</a>, <a href="http://merproject.org/">Mer</a>, <a href="https://meego.com/">MeeGo</a>, <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">webOS</a>, <a href="http://plasma-active.org/">Plasma Active</a>, <a href="https://www.tizen.org/">Tizen</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G">Boot to Gecko</a>, <a href="http://shr-project.org/trac">SHR</a> and other related efforts.<br /><br /> We have the room AW1.120 with 74 seats, a video projector (VGA), wireless internet on Saturday 4th February for a total of 8 hours.<br /><br /> The format we will be utilizing is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk">lightning talks</a> of length 15 minutes with 10 minutes of questions, 5 minute changeover to next speaker. Our goal is about 15 talks during the day.<br /><br /> The motivation is that after each talk, you and your project will be visible to the rest of the Open Mobile Linux community and further deeper discussions into your topic with your peers can continue outside the devroom.</p>
<p>Please send a short biography and an abstract for your talk to <a href="mailto:carsten.munk@gmail.com">carsten.munk@gmail.com</a> by Dec 31st 2011, and we'll get back to you at latest January 7th.</p>
<p>We're also grateful for volunteers helping to run the devroom. Contact Carsten if you're interested.</p>
