Since this was our first hunting trip we concentrated mostly on getting familiar with the forest area and what game can be found there. We slept the night in a Finnish <a href="http://www.kotiposti.net/viherto/laavu%20ja%20loue.html">teepee</a> (<em>laavu</em>) with a fire to keep warm.
</p><p>
During the reconnaissance trips we saw rabbits, reindeer, swans and several species of arctic birds. I got close enough to try to shoot a <a href="http://www.borealforest.org/world/birds/willow_ptarmigan.htm">willow ptarmigan</a> (<em>riekko</em>) from about 35 meters but unfortunately missed. We also got close enough to a rabbit but decided not to shoot because we had too light shots loaded into our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun">shotguns</a>.
</p><p>
Some points for the next trip:
</p><ul><li>Driving 12 hours each way was quite tiring. We should consider taking the car train to Kolari instead</li><li>Camping in middle of the hunting area probably scared some game away. Next time we could camp elsewhere or rent a cabin from Muonio</li><li>We should take a rifle in addition to the shotguns. We could've shot at least one <a href="http://www.birdguides.com/html/vidlib/species/Tetrao_tetrix.htm">black grouse</a> (<em>teeri</em>) with a longer range weapon</li><li>We should try to find a general purpose shotgun cartridge. Something around 3mm shots could work for both grouse and rabbits</li><li>We need to find more about the game we're trying to hunt. Activity periods, habitats etc. to make them easier to find</li><li>Some <a href="http://www.remington.com/NR/exeres/000015b9vxyubuxabkcwfomd/WhatsNew.asp?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2fwhatsnew%2fskeet%2fskeet%2ehtm&NRNODEGUID=%7b74375060-1792-4158-98A7-64447898E28E%7d&NRQUERYTERMINATOR=1&cookie%5Ftest=1">Skeet shooting</a> would be good for accuracy</li></ul><p>
