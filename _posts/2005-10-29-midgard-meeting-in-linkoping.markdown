This weekend is being spent in the [Midgard developer meeting][1] hosted by [Anykey Solutions][2] in [Linköping, Sweden][3]. Besides the [ferry Suicide Tequila episode][4] reported by [Edi][5], the time has been both productive and fun.

Happened so far:

[Tarjei][6] ran a pretty interesting demo and [presentation][7] on the [Aegir 2][8] project. It seems that once the _object browser_ is done, we can safely remove both old Aegir and [SpiderAdmin][9] from the distribution.

After some initial bugs had been hammered out, we also were able to run the [promised][10] demo on managing subcontracted projects with [OpenPsa 2][11] over the [DBE P2P network][12]. I'll try to post screenshots of the whole project workflow after the [Tampere demo][13] on monday.

Another result of the demo was that everybody agreed heartily that [Exorcist][14] should [replace Repligard][15] as Midgard's replication system of choice. This will make replication faster, easier to handle two-way, and push the use of [Java Content Repository][16] in [Midgard CMS][17].

We also had a very good discussion about refining Midgard's [style engine][18] to work on a clearer [stack model][19]. This will make [MidCOM's][20] style template system integrate transparently into Midgard's powerful page composition system, and make the eventual page transition of MidCOM much easier.

Also, the annoying [MySQL 4.1 typecasting bug][21] got fixed, [Midgard 1.9 feature requirements][22] got decided, and many people wrote their first MidCOM component based on Tarjei's tutorial.

In the saturday evening we had a thai dinner in the [SmallOne Mansion][23].
