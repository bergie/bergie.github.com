Senaki, headed on M1 to Tbilisi. Nice weather and good road.

</p>

<p>
Gori, 96km to Tbilisi. Nice mountain roads. Every time I stop the bike gathers a huge audience.
 <em>(2004-07-21 15:53 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Tbilisi, odometer at 60474km. Giving interview to Georgian national television.
 <em>(2004-07-21 16:45 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
After the TV interviews the Camelot MC members escorted me in a convoy to a bike store where the owner presented me riding gloves.

</p>

<p>
We're having a traditional dinner outside by the river in restaurant Nikala in Old Tbilisi.
 <em>(2004-07-21 20:45 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Beers on Turtle lake beach. I was invited to a religious night festival with trappist beer on a mountain top monastery during the weekend.

</p>

<p>
Just for the record, the two TV interviews I gave will be shown tomorrow between 8:30 and 10 in morning programs of Rustavi 2 and Georgia 1.
 <em>(2004-07-21 23:11 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Both of the interviews looked quite good, especially the riding shots. Everything was dubbed to Georgian so I have no idea what was being said.

</p>

<p>
It rains in biblical scale, flooding the hilly streets. Tbilisi metro is an experience, as everything is written only in Georgian alphabet.
 <em>(2004-07-22 10:55 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The Polish backpackers, Ania and Nata managed to get to Tbilisi. We're holding rain in a cafe and comparing sightseeing plans.
 <em>(2004-07-22 14:19 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The flood has barricaded us to Tbilisi city museum. We're debating whether to wade or stay here. Nice 19th century item collection.
 <em>(2004-07-22 15:29 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Finally sunshine! Driving with the group to Mtshketa, the ancient capital. All traffic cops in Georgia have been fired because of reforms.
 <em>(2004-07-22 18:15 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Last night we visited the Djvari 6th century hilltop monastery and had another Georgian dinner on the river. Today we'll go to the countryside.
 <em>(2004-07-23 10:01 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
After a bit of touring in Old Tbilisi we're going to sauna in the old 19th century sulphuric health baths.
 <em>(2004-07-23 11:57 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
After sauna we climbed to the Narikala castle. Now a light lunch and I'll go pack the bike and check out from hotel Victoria.
 <em>(2004-07-23 14:43 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Visiting the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050422042935/http://www.iatp.ge/en/">Internet Access and Training Program</a> (IATP) offices where Taya works. Then we'll start the ride to Shilda, a small village in east Georgia. The plan is to spend the weekend there and see some ordinary Georgian life.
</p>

<p>
We're spending weekend in a mountain village near Kvareli, and there might be no cell phone coverage. Girls are taking turns riding pillion.
 <em>(2004-07-23 19:11 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The house is in absolutely beautiful place. I'll sleep on balcony under the stars with view to the blue peaks of Caucasus.
 <em>(2004-07-23 21:15 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The Milky Way and swooping satellites shine above Caucasus as  we barbeque sausages filled with goat cheese and taste the local natural wines.
 <em>(2004-07-23 21:55 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
A long, hot climb got me up to the 8th century hilltop monastery of Nekresi. Tried enduroing up but the street tyres kept slipping.
 <em>(2004-07-24 12:03 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Picnic lunch of bread, cheese and churchkhelas at a mountain spring. On the other side of the Caucasus ridge, few kilometers away is Dagestan.
 <em>(2004-07-24 13:41 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
We're exploring the 15th century Gremi palace on the old Asia-Europe trade route. In the process we've scared quite a few bats.
 <em>(2004-07-24 15:57 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
As night settles on Caucasus we again marvel the Georgian hospitality while preparing shashlik. Ania and Nata are learning how to milk cows.
 <em>(2004-07-24 20:29 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
We were taken to the neighbor's wine cellar where they produce it with traditional methods. White wine was really good with some fresh cheese.
 <em>(2004-07-25 10:01 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
On a hill walk with the villagers we were shown the memorial spring of poet Vazha Pshavela and the old smugglers' mountain route from Dagestan.
 <em>(2004-07-25 13:29 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Taya's father, Valeri fixed the hanging rear right indicator and we're thinking of how to enforce and fix the license plate that's shaking apart
 <em>(2004-07-25 15:27 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The villagers gave us several bottles of local wine and chacha, the Georgian moonshine as farewell gifts. I also got a book about the region.
 <em>(2004-07-25 17:17 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The ride to Tbilisi was first scenic with setting sun drawing silhuettes of mountains and castles, and then a dark, wet and potholed nightmare.
 <em>(2004-07-25 21:33 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
We're now meeting seven Polish bikers on their way to Armenia together with Camelot MC. Table is filled with vodka shots and I have to ride back
 <em>(2004-07-25 21:35 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Today we're headed to Kazbeki on the old Georgian military highway carved to the mountains. I'm on the bike and girls will take a marshrutka.
 <em>(2004-07-26 07:51 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Castle Ananuri. I'm taking photos while girls discuss who gets to ride pillion next. Very beautiful, twisty mountain road.
 <em>(2004-07-26 09:33 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Kazbeki, odometer at 61036km. The mountain scenery was awesome but the road terrible. Lost my rear brake for a while in the bumps.
 <em>(2004-07-26 11:49 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
We're having a light lunch on the hillside before trying to proceed to the Sameba church on the top. Thunderstorm is coming.
 <em>(2004-07-26 14:15 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Flooded path and heavy hail forced us to turn back just before the summit. Now we're treading between the streams back down to the village.
 <em>(2004-07-26 14:49 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The mountain road back had collapsed in rain and I got stuck. A friendly driver helped me to push the bike out in knee-deep mud.
 <em>(2004-07-26 18:21 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
There were problems with the driver the girls had hired. He kept trying to get extra money out of everything and drove away when I got stuck.
 <em>(2004-07-26 19:37 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Now back in Tbilisi. The stoyanka keeper wasn't satisfied until I shared my story and his vodka. Now we're preparing for a farewell dinner.
 <em>(2004-07-26 19:43 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Farewell dinner in Valeri's home with long Georgian toasts, including one for the people waiting at home.
 <em>(2004-07-26 23:15 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Last night's party got quite rowdy and emotional. Now we'll go to Taya's office to upload pictures and then I'll start heading west.
 <em>(2004-07-27 08:37 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Cured hangover at lunch with Nata, Taya and Guram, and riding out from Tbilisi. It is late so I  will miss the cave city this time.
 <em>(2004-07-27 15:47 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Khasuri, 130km from Tbilisi. Turned southwest to M8 to Batumi. Stopping to apply sun lotion.
 <em>(2004-07-27 17:17 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Gas break in Akhaltsikhe in shadow of a castle. Turkish border 10km away is closed for the night so on to Batumi and the setting sun.
 <em>(2004-07-27 18:45 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
In Adzharia the 'red' road turned from bad to terrible gravel with no signs. Treading on at 20km/h without rear brake.
 <em>(2004-07-27 19:43 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Too dark and dangerous to ride so I'm staying in guest room of a tea house in Goderdzi Pass (2025m). Very scenic.
 <em>(2004-07-27 20:51 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Had a dinner and lots of conversation in broken Russian with the tea house people. Now going to sleep with bike hopefully staying on the porch.
 <em>(2004-07-27 22:31 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
The morning has painted the mountains very beautiful. I pack the bike, pay the innkeeper and start descending. Uaz jeep can get to Batumi in 3h.
 <em>(2004-07-28 07:03 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
After 80km of traktor trails since leaving Akhaltsikhe the road is starting to improve as it winds downwards. And the rear brake has returned.
 <em>(2004-07-28 08:37 - Bergie)</em>
</p>

<p>
Batumi. Trying to get some photos printed before heading to Turkish border.
 <em>(2004-07-28 10:25 - Bergie)</em>
