<p>
The <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/InForm/index.htm">form styling templates</a> provided in the tutorial utilize two HTML form-specific elements for defining the structure of the form: <a href="http://www.devguru.com/Technologies/xhtml/quickref/xhtml_label.html">label</a> and <a href="http://www.devguru.com/Technologies/xhtml/quickref/xhtml_fieldset.html">fieldset</a>.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>
For usability and accesibility reasons, every form element on a page should have an associated label. Not only do labels let you focus a form element by clicking on its label text (no more fiddling around clicking on the exact circle that is the radio button), but they enable non-visual browsers to create an association between the label text and the form element, allowing each distinct item to be more readily identified.

<p>We have been <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004/2004-04-16-001.html">looking</a> at making the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/">MidCOM</a> editing forms more accessible. This solution is starting to look really good. Time to post a bug?<br /></p>
<p>Examples like the <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/InForm/columnar.htm">columnar form</a> also throw <a href="http://rambo.pbt-unknown.org/">Rambo's</a> notion that <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/">OpenPSA</a> couldn't be built using MidCOM datamanager because it uses very strict form layouts out of the window.<br /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 9:56:</span> Posted <a href="http://midcom.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=50">bug #50</a> to get MidCOM datamanager to support this way of building forms.<br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 2004-05-24:</span> Torben accepted this enhancement into the roadmap for MidCOM 1.4.0<br /></p>
