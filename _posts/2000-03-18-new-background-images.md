I posted some new background images

Crepperie Oy sent me some of their photos taken from the Keskiaikaiset Karnevaalit medieval festival. One of the images was a nice, sunny picture taken from The Grey Wolves' booth there.

Looking at the image, I got the inspiration to see how it would like pasted on my current desktop background image. The result, with some text added, is now available from my site.
