[Tony Byrne of CMS Watch notes][1] that there is nothing special about [the web][2] any more:

> Forthwith, the following terms, "web, website, webcast, internet, intranet, the net" shall merit only lower-case treatment. So be it. The web has become part of the fabric of business and, increasingly, personal information exchange. It's become less of a place and more of an approach -- or put another way, more of an adjective than a noun.

About time, I think.
