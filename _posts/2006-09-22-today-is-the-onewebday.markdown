September 22nd is the [OneWebDay][1]. It is a day when users of the World Wide Web are encouraged to show how the Internet affects their lives. The purpose of the event is to globally celebrate online life.

While there are no OneWebDay events in Helsinki, I've noted the day by publishing a bunch of [new packages][2] for [Midgard CMS][3], a tool designed to improve the web.
