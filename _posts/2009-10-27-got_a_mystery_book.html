<p>When returning from lunch today I found a package on my office desk. The handwriting on the envelope looked familiar from pictures I had seen on Qaiku before, so it was clear: I had <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/channels/show/Mysteerikirja/view/1dec2ecb7672c70c2ec11de9a9e4180e9a28cda8cda/">received my own mystery book</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/files/1dec324852f9570c32411deb5a29f762cafab34ab34_mystery_book-png.jpg" border="0" alt="mystery_book.png" title="mystery_book.png" /></p>
<p>Mystery books have been received by many <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/community/">prominent Qaiku members</a> before. They are beautifully handcrafted notebooks personalized for the recipient, often containing hints about Qaiku involvement, like having the inner covers made in printed version of that user's profile background. There is no information about the sender or the reason for making them. All are sent from random Turku post offices.</p>
<p>My copy of the mystery book is a mobile notebook, a bit in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moleskine">Moleskine</a>-like style. The inner covers have <a href="http://www.emersonkent.com/images/europe_1810.jpg">a map of Europe from 1810</a>, fitting my interest in history and geography spot-on. The book came with a pen, and had been sent from <a href="http://www.verkkoposti.com/e3/TOPIinternetServlet?STATE=1&amp;lang=fi&amp;LOTUS_encoding=UTF-8&amp;TOPI_key=20100&amp;TOPI_hae=Hae">Turku 10</a> at 12:02 yesterday.</p>
<p>Several Qaiku members have posted pictures of their books on Flickr with tag "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/mysteerikirja/">mysteerikirja</a>", and there is <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/channels/show/Mysteerikirja/">a Qaiku channel</a> about it. It remains to be seen whether the books are some viral marketing campaign, or have been made by some individual with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9lie">Am√©lie</a>-like tendencies. Anyway, quite a delightful surprise!</p>
