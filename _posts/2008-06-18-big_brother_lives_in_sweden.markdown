But looks like the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/17/swedish-journalists.html">Swedish are eager</a> to get there first. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-06-18-sweden_N.htm">Sweden passed a controversial wiretapping law</a>:
</p><blockquote>
Sweden on Wednesday adopted contentious legislation that will give officials sweeping powers to eavesdrop on all e-mail and telephone traffic that crosses the Nordic nation's borders.
<br /><br />...
<br /><br />"This is just as absurd as before. It contravenes article 12 of the U.N.'s declaration of human rights," said Per Strom from The New Welfare Foundation think tank. "It will still create a society characterized by self-censorship and anxiety."

Remember people, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a> was meant to be a warning, <a href="http://notes2self.net/archive/2008/03/23/1984-was-meant-to-be-a-warning-not-a-template.aspx">not an instruction manual</a>. Time to move the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a> community servers out from that country?
