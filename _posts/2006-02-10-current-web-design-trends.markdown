[Web Design from Scratch][1] has a pretty good analysis of the [current style in web design][2]:

>  Today's web designs are so fresh, they feel like they've taken a deep breath.

> Sometimes I imagine taking a page design that's too crowded and sticking it on a balloon, then blowing air in until everything on the page pulls apart to leave healthy gaps.

> Your eye needs space (guttering in typo language) round stuff to help you clearly and cleanly identify things.

> In general, the more white space the better. It's very rare that I look at a page and think: "Gosh, they really need to cram that page up a bit!"
