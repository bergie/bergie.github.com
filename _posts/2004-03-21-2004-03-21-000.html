Integrating Dashboard support to <a href="http://www.nemein.com/en/nemeinnet/">Nemein.Net</a> might be interesting. NN already stores information related to persons in several places, including:<br /><ul><li>Contacts database</li><li>Sales projects</li><li>Support requests</li><li>Project contacts</li></ul>In addition to those, we will probably have to start connecting Calendar entries to persons from the Contacts database. The Calendar API already <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/reference/eventmember/object">supports</a> connecting any person records to the entry, but there is no user interface to this.<br /><br />With Dashboard Nemein.Net users could very easily display all relevant information about a customer service contact or a sales prospect, showing details like &quot;emails sent by the person&quot;, &quot;IRC chats with the person&quot; and &quot;support requests sent by the person&quot; in one simple window.<br /><br />It might even be possible to query and display this information dynamically when reading email or receiving a phone call from that person.<br /><br />While <a href="http://www.nemein.com/en/">Nemein</a> has switched from GNOME on the desktop to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a>, this kind of application would still be interesting to experiment with.<br /><br />Some <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/rview.cgi?cvsroot=/cvs/gnome&dir=dashboard/doc">documentation</a> on Dashboard is available. The front end applications (email or VOIP client, IM application) tell backend systems to look up information related to a person or concept by sending a <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/cvsblame.cgi?file=dashboard%2Fdoc/cluepacket.txt&rev=&root=/cvs/gnome">cluepacket</a>. Documentation on writing the backend interfaces <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/cvsblame.cgi?file=dashboard%2Fdoc/writing-backends.txt&rev=&root=/cvs/gnome">is available</a>.<br />
