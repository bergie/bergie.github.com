<blockquote style="">As an analogy, the news reader acts like a customizable newspaper. You can pull a variety of content from a growing number of sources into one place, to be read however you choose. Sources like major news media outlets (BBC, Reuters, Washington Post) to non-news content providers (Apples iTunes Music Store, the Government of Canada, USGS World Earthquake updates) to smaller independent voices (BoingBoing, VanEats, Sidesh0w). The only stipulation is that the source must provide a feed; many are. </blockquote><p>Both <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS</a> and <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">Atom</a> are content management standards <a href="http://www.oscom.org/standards/">recommended</a> by <a href="http://www.oscom.org/">OSCOM</a>.</p>
