<blockquote>&quot;...automated business systems are being retrofitted to generate data in RSS format. For example, Triple Point uses StarTeam for source control and release management... In the past, developers were required to produce email announcements of each source code change; now that process has been automated via RSS.&quot;</blockquote>

This is an interesting concept. Since RSS feeds are automatically generated by the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/">MidCOM</a> newsticker component, I've started monitoring the news items of our clients and partner companies in my <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> RSS aggregator.This helps me keep up-to-date with what they are doing a lot easier.<br /><br />The next logical step would be to take RSS implementation even further in MidCOM and Nemein.Net. Already components like <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/components/de.linkm.newsticker">newsticker</a>, <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/components/net.siriux.photos">photos</a> and <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/components/net.nemein.rss">rss</a> provide RSS output, but same could be done for discussion, events and many others.<br /><p><br /></p>
