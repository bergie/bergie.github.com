The fact that<a href="http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html"> our VoIP provider</a> has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_Protocol">proprietary closed network</a> has <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/gizmo-and-the-new-skype-ui/">bothered me</a> for a while. In their <a href="http://spicygadget.com/blog/2007/02/04/nokia-n800-internet-tablet-review/">N800 review</a>, <a href="http://spicygadget.com/blog/2007/02/04/nokia-n800-internet-tablet-review/5/">Spicy Gadget Roll put it well</a>:
<blockquote>The two instant messengers found in the N800 are Jabber and Google Talk. Both instant messengers are built on open standards, which I whole-heartedly believe in. There’s a lot of confusion as to why these open standards are even relevant. I’d like to clear this confusion up by spending some time on the subject. Think about this for a moment, a Hotmail user can send an e-mail to a Gmail user, a Cingular customer can call a T-Mobile customer, but we can only send instant messages to people within our IM network? Something is awfully wrong with this picture.</blockquote><a href="http://www.imfederation.com/">IM federation</a> is a great start for fixing the situation. Next we need a proper, open and standardized VoIP solution. There are some contenders for that position, including <a href="http://openwengo.com/">OpenWengo</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo Project</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/jep_extensions/jingleinfo.html">Google Talk / Jingle</a>. From my point of view all of these come still short, though, as none seem to provide decent video-capable clients for both Mac and <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo</a>.
