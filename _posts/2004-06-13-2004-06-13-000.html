The longest stop with refueling, refreshing the team and washing the windscreen took 2 minutes and 39 seconds. In total there were six gas breaks. Our black leather team clothes must also have helped in winning.<br /><br />The race was at its best when we had some very tight chase scenes with the Fc Smurffit team. Especially the turning point in Hammerfest was exciting.<br /><br />All cars finished the race successfully, with the <a href="http://www.routamc.org/sprintti-2004/escort">last team</a> arriving to finish almost 10 hours behind us.<br />
