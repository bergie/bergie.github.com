First part of the movie tells a very appealing and realistic tale of a motorcycle road trip in the third world. Many of the scenes and situations feel very familiar with my <a title="Routa MC - Bergie's motorcycle trip stories and photos" href="http://www.routamc.org/">own road trips</a>.<br /><br />After the sad demise of their '39 Norton the movie gets more serious, and describes the Che's <a title="Siddhartha Gautama's story" href="http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/siddhartha.html">Siddhartha-like</a> enlightment through views into the poverty and plight of the Indians and rural workers. The stories of despair and unemployment in the fifties are very similar to the descriptions in <a title="Jupitalia - Ted Simon's home page" href="http://www.jupitalia.com/">Ted Simon's</a> mid-seventies <a title="Jupiter's travels" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=bergiesweblog-20&path=tg/detail/-/0965478505/qid%3D1094461122/sr%3D8-1">Jupiter's travels</a>.<br /><br />The movie was based on the Che's and Alberto's personal travel journals and photos.
