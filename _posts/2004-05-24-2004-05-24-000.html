<p>The BBC article mostly concentrates on the British historical aspects of the island.</p>

<blockquote>
Vis, nearly thirty miles south of Split off the coast of Dalmatia, has had an interesting half century. It was where Tito made his headquarters in World War II: soon afterwards, he seized control of Yugoslavia, which he ruled autocratically until his death in 1980.

<p>The Routa MC website has <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/albums/72157652225268539">bunch of photos</a> from the Summer Source event.<br /></p>
<p>Hopefully there will be opportunities to visit the island again...<br />
