Nemein Solutions, the leading Nordic provider of Midgard solutions arranges a free Midgard installfest on August 14th, starting at 17:00.

Midgard is a freely-available solution for managing content on web and WAP services. It is also a toolkit for building dynamic applications to power eBusiness and Information Management processes. Midgard has been built and is actively maintained a global group of software professionals working together in this Open Source project.

The event enables people interested in the project to get installation help from Nemein's consultants. It is also a good opportunity to get more information on and discuss the usage of the Midgard application server, and applications available for it.

Participants needing help with their Midgard installations should either bring their computers to the location, or provide SSH connectivity to the systems.
