Since [Midgard][2] is [now able to import][1] my Jaiku presence information, I've finally switched to it completely [from Twitter][4]. Since the discussion about the merits of these two different services are being discussed actively, I though I should give some of my reasons:

* Jaiku cleanly separates comments from presence, keeping it clear what is your current status, and what a discussion is about

* Jaiku is able to import external presence-related data like [my blog entries][5], [Flickr photos][7], [Youtube videos][8] and [Plazes tracks][9] as they come online, but also these are separated from the actual presence updates (or tweets, if you prefer the term)

* Jaiku is based here in [Helsinki, Finland][6]. This means it is so much easier for me to meet them if I for example want to discuss some integration ideas in the future

* Jaiku makes it much easier to [invite my contacts][10] to the network. Instead of requiring me to hunt email addresses, I can just log into Google Talk via Jaiku's site and automatically invite all my buddies

* Jaiku gets more than just the web. I love the idea of adding [presence information to my mobile phone's phonebook][11]. This way I can check that I won't be disturbing people before calling them, and opt for sending an unobtrusive SMS instead

* The mobile phone app [gets contextual information][15] as well, apparently marking me as busy based on my calendar reservations. I wish it updated my location from Plazes as well, though

* And finally, Jaiku is slightly prettier

The areas Twitter wins in, on the other hand, are:

* [Simpler user interface][14]. There is only the status entry box

* Better desktop integration via [various apps and widgets][12]

For me, the advantages Jaiku gives are clearly bigger than the ones Twitter has.  This means that the [status data on my site][13] now comes from there, and people wanting to keep in touch are more than welcome to [add me][3] as their Jaiku contact.
