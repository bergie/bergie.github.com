We drove to Poland following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Baltica">E67</a>, the <a href="http://www.respons.pp.fi/~respons-/viabaltica/engl/indexanglb.html">Via Baltica</a>. I've now driven the road in three summers, and the improvements are quite visible. Roads are getting better all the time, and now that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltics">Baltic countries</a> are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_union">EU</a> border checks were a breeze. Another big improvement is in credit card acceptance. <a href="http://www.visa.fi/">Visa</a> was accepted everywhere in Baltic countries so we didn't have to withdraw any local currency.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/gallery/poznan-2004/IMG_1954.html"><img src="http://www.midgard-project.org/midcom-serveattachmentguid-cbed9ae07fe193b69f45894c11b0c6cc/thumbnail_IMG_1954.jpg" /></a><br /></div> <p>The actual Midgard developer meeting started in friday afternoon, and continued until sunday. There was much piwo and good discussion. Especially <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/whoswho/ab.html">Alexander's </a><a href="http://www.nathan-syntronics.de/midgard/ragnaroek/">Ragnaroek</a> presentation was impressive. Hopefully he will finish the white paper based on session notes soon. We also enjoyed some <a href="http://cigar-store.port5.com/h.-upmann-cigars.shtml">Cuban cigars</a> to celebrate <a href="http://www.kaukolaweb.com/">Kaukola's</a> graduation. The local restaurants like <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/poznan/en/venue?id=POPZENR0158">Sphinx</a> and <a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/poznan/en/venue?id=POPZENR0063">Ali Baba</a> were quite nice. Poland is certainly the place to go for eating ;-)<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.world66.com/europe/poland/poznan">Poznan</a> had a very nice looking old city, but unfortunately there was little time for tourism. Maybe in June, if a project proposal works out.<br /></p>

<p>On the return trip we picked up Luihu from <a href="http://www.world66.com/europe/germany/berlin">Berlin</a> and drove 22 hours straight to <a href="http://www.world66.com/europe/sweden/stockholm">Stockholm</a>. From there we took the <a href="http://www.silja.fi/LAIVAT/Silja%20Serenade/">Midgard-powered ferry</a> back to Helsinki. Sauna on the ferry was excellent medicine for aching muscles from the long drive. The Land Rover worked again quite well as a road trip vehicle, despite having to change a tyre in Denmark at 5am.<br /></p>Some <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/gallery/poznan-2004/">photos are available</a> on the Midgard site.<br />
