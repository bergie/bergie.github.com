Our new apartment is located in the <a href="http://www.popangel.fi/map.html">Five Corners</a> district of Helsinki. A nice two-room flat on 7th floor with view over the roofs of the city. It had been renovated for the previous inhabitant, so it is in almost brand new shape - even though the building was constructed in the 60s.

I liked my previous apartment on Eerikinkatu, but 21 square meters was simply too small for the two of us.

Yesterday we borrowed <a href="http://www.nemein.com/people/rambo/">Rambo's</a> Land Rover after the work and drove enough stuff here so we can stay at the new place: futon, Internet connection, clothes and kitchen utensils. We'll move the furniture and rest of the stuff later with a bigger car.
