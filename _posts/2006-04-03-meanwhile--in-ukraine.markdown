It has to be said the Ukrainian political advertising scena has changed quite a bit from [what I saw][1] during the [Orange Revolution][2].

> These are allegedly real photos of the pre-election posters for Yulia Tymoshenko - nicknamed "the Orange Princess" - one of the leaders of the Orange revolution in Ukraine. Her party came in second in the recent general election with ~22.4% of votes. 

Via [Boing Boing][3].

During the revolution the streets were mostly filled with orange banners and stickers saying "Tak, Yushchenko" (Yes, Yushchenko). And [Yulia's][9] new campaign has apparently worked:

> Tymoshenko re-energized her [Bloc][4] and entered the [parliamentary elections][5] of March 2006 as its leader, earning an estimated 130 seats, causing speculation that Yushchenko's [Our Ukraine][6] party and Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko may unite in coalition (with the [Socialist Party of Ukraine][7]) in order to keep the [Party of Regions][8] from gaining power. She again stated her desire to become Prime Minister in such a coalition. Her party would be the biggest party in a reformed "Orange Coalition".
