Here are the [Midgard CMS][1] slides we presented to two major potential Finnish customers on friday:

[Midgard presentation in Finnish (256 KB PDF)](/files/Midgard_CMS-20051111.pdf)

While the slides were made half-asleep on an early morning train from the [Tampere COSS meeting][2] and are so not very [presentation Zen][3] ish, they try to focus on couple of key points with Midgard and [Nemein][4]:

* Midgard's standard integration interfaces like Java Content Repository
* Connectivity to Midgard from different client tools; mobile phones, browsers, etc
* Nemein's strong client portfolio

It went across quite well to both organizations. Expect to hear some announcements related to that later on.
