The discussion on the matter continues on Slashdot thread &quot;<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/02/0026234&mode=thread&tid=106&tid=107&tid=185&tid=187">Making Things Easy is Hard</a>&quot;.<br /><br />With Midgard, there are several major issues affecting usability:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation is horrible:</span> solution would be to provide prebuilt packages for popular Linux/Unix platforms</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site setup is difficult:</span> we should integrate sitegroup creation, host creation from template, style creation, site initialization and VirtualHost setting into one simple &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">Create website</span>&quot; dialog</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content editing is difficult:</span> managing content is still quite difficult. However, the process on fixing MidCOM AIS usability flaws is going on</li></ul><h2>Fixes to Authoring Interface System</h2>Usually the Midgard installation and setup is done by a technical solution provider, so the usability issues there are not as urgent. However, AIS is what the end-user sees, making it the prime usability fixing target.<br /><br />Several improvements are being made, or discussed to the MidCOM AIS:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Back to page:</span> link returning from AIS to the &quot;view&quot; side of the site. With this we can get rid of all the ugly returnurl hacks</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power User:</span> hiding all confusing settings from non-power users. Power user setting should be <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/reference/parameter/used-parameters">shared with Aegir</a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consistent UIs:</span> the user interface for managing all components should be made consistent. Buttons should look the same and behave similarly, and components should share UIs for creating and deleting pages, etc</li></ul>Actually, it looks like I should write a <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/mrfc/">Midgard Request for Comments</a> on this.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 13:25</span>: Started working on <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/mrfc/0003.html">mRFC 0003</a>, &quot;MidCOM AIS User Interface Guidelines&quot;. I'll try to get <a href="http://siriux.net/">Nico</a> and <a href="http://midgard.evtek.fi/henriok/">Kaukola</a> to collaborate on this.<br />
