Despite Bergie's original intentions, the launching of his Design Portfolio site gets delayed.

First I must apologize from you all, because the most likely reason you are here in the first place is still missing from the site. My design portfolio remains unpublished altough I strongly intended to launch it during this weekend.

This is because the hard drive of my office computer died under mysterious circumstances after a power failure. With it died the user interface elements I had planned on including to the website.

The content for the portfolio is there, and the UI is also mostly working, being crafted after the one used in my site's News section. But I feel that it still needs slight polishing and so its launch shall wait until next week.

We shall see if this deadline will hold.
