This weekend I will be speaking in the <a href="http://froscon.phpugdo.de/">PHP at Froscon</a> track in <a href="http://www.froscon.org/">FrOSCon conference</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankt_Augustin">Sankt Augustin</a>, Germany about <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/node/181">managing your personal information space with Midgard</a>:

<blockquote><p>Social web services like Flickr and del.icio.us provide new ways to work and share data with others. However, they also mean that your data is spread around dozens of services, companies and servers.</p>
<p>
Midgard can be set up to act as your personal information hub, synchronizing your content with the various Web 2.0 services and displaying them in your own style as a mashup. This means your content can also be secure in a server you control.
</p><p>
You can connect the data from different services together and enrich it with data produced with Midgard's own components. Consider for example having the following play nicely together:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog entries coming from an external blog service or Midgard itself</li>
<li>Bookmarks coming from del.icio.us</li>
<li>Photos coming from Flickr</li>
<li>Videos coming from Youtube</li>
<li>Status messages coming from Twitter and Jaiku</li>
<li>...all connected with geolocation data coming from Plazes and shared via RSS feeds and Microformats</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this session we look at how such a personal information space can be set up with Midgard, and how new functionalities or data connections can be developed for it.</p></blockquote>

While I'm using <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard's</a> Web 2.0 integration features as an example, many ideas should be of interest to developers of other CMSs as well.

Catch the talk at 15:15 this Saturday in the <a href="http://froscon.phpugdo.de/">PHP room</a>!
