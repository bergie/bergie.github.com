    Some quick notes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Outside old city centers the buildings made after beginning
    of 60s have so thin walls that they provide essentially no
    cover
    </li>
    <li>There are aerosol weapons which shoot a gas-filled
    projectile into a room. The projectile then fills the room with
    an explosive gas
        <br />
        Chechens have learned to combat this by moving their
        positions inwards in the buildings and lighting a bonfire
        in the room next to the window. This makes the aerosol gas
        burn safely before reaching explosive stage
    </li>
    <li>Upper floors of buildings are not a good place for
    defensive positions as they are easily collapsed. Fire spreads
    very quickly upwards
    </li>
    <li>Safest place for supply and deployment routes is
    underground using cellars, sewage pipes etc.
    </li>
</ul>
