[Tigert][1] has been [sketching][10] some [Tango][2]-styled UIs for the [new Aegir][3] admin interface of [Midgard CMS][4]:

<a href="http://tigert.com/files/uploads/aegir2-layout.png"><img src="http://tigert.com/files/uploads/aegir2-layout-thumb.png" alt="Aegir 2 in Tango" title="Aegir 2 in Tango" style="border: none; margin-left: 10px;" /></a>

Now this is all still [Inkscape][5]-level stuff, but once we get a bit further we plan to contribute the core parts of the CSS design back to the Tango project.

Tango is a project to develop a common style that could be used across [GNOME][6] and [KDE][7] desktops. The idea is that using the shared outlook applications between different systems (and third-party applications that don't originate from either desktop environment) would fit together quite seamlessly. With [Freedesktop][8] handling much of the technical interoperability, Tango could solve the UI consistency.

The same could be done between the different Open Source CMS systems and web tools. Tango could easily be something for [OSCOM][9] to push as an interop project.
