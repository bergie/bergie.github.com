<p>A while ago I blogged about my <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/gnome3_on_ubuntu_natty-the_first_impressions/">impressions on running Ubuntu Natty and GNOME3</a> on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a>. As I've gotten some questions about the laptop itself, I decided to write something about it.</p>
<p>Simply put, the 11" MacBook Air is the best computer I've ever had. I've always appreciated small and light laptops as I <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/bergie">travel quite a bit</a>, but this one takes portability to a completely new level. The laptop weights only a kilogram, and is small enough to fit pretty much any bag. And it is pretty:</p>
<p><img src="/static/1/1e071b17632db3071b111e09d42ef63fbf46c4b6c4b_macbook_air_3_2.jpg" border="0" alt="macbook_air_3_2.jpg" title="macbook_air_3_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Funnily enough, it has a slower processor than my previous work laptop (1.4 GHz vs. 1.6 GHz), but the fast SSD makes a huge difference. Pretty much anything I do on the device feels faster. It appears <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/04/mba-qs/">Brooks Review agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote>...my MacBook Air is the best Mac I have ever owned — hands down — no contest. I have had everything from the fabled 12″ Powerbook G4 to a pimped out Mac Pro — the MacBook Air takes the cake here. It is incredibly fast for 95% of everything that I do and the screen resolution is amazing give the small footprint of the machine. The size and weight of the machine still amazes me every time I touch it.</blockquote>
<p>Battery life is also <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2010/10/30/macbook-air-2010-battery-life/">quite good</a>, with Linux giving me about 3-4 hours per charge. This could obviously be better, and I dream of the 10+ hours an Arm processor would give.</p>
<h2>Why Linux?</h2>
<p>Why do I run Linux on the system? First of all, I appreciate the <a href="http://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">software freedom</a>. I also love the predictable release cycles that Ubuntu and GNOME give me: every six months there is a new release with a set of features announced early on. And since <a href="http://nemein.com/en/">we</a> deploy our software <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/nemein_is_going_to_ubuntu_server/">on Ubuntu</a>, my own development environment has automatically the same set of packages and versions available. Midgard, Node.js, etc. are <a href="http://cloudhead.io/2011/04/18/why-osx-doesnt-cut-it/">all available from the repositories</a>.</p>
<p>I also like GNOME's <a href="http://gnome3.org/">focus on simplicity</a>. Unlike OS X, the user interface has very few unnecessary elements, and the desktop itself has been designed to let me focus on the task at hand, minimizing distractions.</p>
<p>Installing Ubuntu on the system is <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/10561/how-to-install-on-a-macbook-air-3-2-without-an-external-cd-drive">not exactly trivial</a>, but after a bit of setup everything works as it should: suspending, wireless, webcam, everything. And boot times are also pleasantly fast. Compared to previous Ubuntu versions, network acquisition after resume is also very fast, comparable to OS X.</p>
<h2>Gripes</h2>
<p>As said, battery life could be better. Ten hours would give me trouble-free working environment when traveling, as now I often have to prioritize when to use the computer and for what in fear that no power outlet is available.</p>
<p>I also hate the display adapters Apple forces us to buy and carry around. I give a lot of presentations, and this is another piece of equipment to accidentally leave home. Why not just go VGA or HDMI?</p>
<p>In both of these aspects the similarly compact <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Booklet_3G">Nokia Booklet</a> would've been better. Unfortunately it has been a while since that "business netbook" was released and there has been no word of newer versions.</p>
<p>Another gripe is related to the stability of the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/gnome3/+packages">GNOME3 PPA release</a> for Natty. There are some regressions compared to stock Ubuntu. I hope that will be eventually fixed now that <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu">Natty is officially out</a>. Shame that Canonical wanted to <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/">do their own thing</a> instead of going with GNOME.</p>
