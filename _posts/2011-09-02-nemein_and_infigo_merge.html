<p>Yesterday the contracts were signed to acquire <a href="http://infigo.fi/en/">Infigo</a> as part of <a href="http://nemein.com/en/">Nemein</a>. Infigo, is a consulting company focused on mobile development and web using open source tools. You'll probably at least know their CTO, <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/on_usb_fingers_and_world_news/">Jerry of the USB finger fame</a>.</p>
<p>Even in the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/ten_years_of_nemein/">ten years of history</a> of our company this is quite a significant move - it allows us to combine Nemein's traditional expertise on content management with Infigo's mobile offerings. As smartphones and tablets are becoming popular, more and more services we build will have a mobile element, which is now easier with lots of in-house expertise.</p>
<p>This also means more focus on the interplay between the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a> content repository, <a href="https://github.com/bergie/noflo">NoFlo</a> workflows, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> web services, and mobile applications built in <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://infigo.fi/en/page/company/team">Petri Rajahalme</a> (with me in the photo) will be the CEO of the merged company, and I will focus on leading the R&amp;D efforts.</p>
