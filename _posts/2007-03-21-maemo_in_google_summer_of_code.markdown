[Maemo][1], the development platform for [Nokia's Internet Tablets][2] is one of the organizations [participating][4] in [Google Summer of Code 2007][3]. SoC is a program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects.

I'm [one of the mentors][7] for Maemo projects. Students [can apply][5] for the program until __March 26th__. If you want to work on Maemo (and especially positioning-related) applications, add your idea [to the wiki][6] ASAP!
