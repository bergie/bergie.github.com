<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">Microblogging</a> is all about conversations. About interesting ideas, and the opinions and clarifications to those. About discovering things happening around you.
</p><p>
But to be honest, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and its clones like <a href="http://identi.ca/">Identi.ca</a> do not do that so well. Ease of posting, and good external tools might be there, but what lacks is the possibility to have real conversations. That is where <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> has been shining: the original posts follow the traditional microblogging concept of conversation starters being limited to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service">SMS</a>-like 140 characters. But responses to those are not limited similarly, allowing thoughtful commentary to be written.
</p><p>
That is something that simply doesn't happen on Twitter: <em>thoughtful discussion</em>. The poor <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/05/how-replies-work-on-twitter-and-how.html">threading model</a>, and lack of differentiation between conversation starters and comments simply means everybody ends up shouting on top of each other.
</p><p>
<a href="http://brightkite.com/">Brightkite</a>, a location-aware microblogging service almost gets there. It differentiates conversation starters and comments from each other, and adds quite cool <a href="http://www.technologyevangelist.com/2008/05/brightkite_location.html">location-aware</a> features on top of that. Suddenly I can follow conversations happening in the same neighborhood, or in the same city! But the problem is that they have made posting a little bit too cumbersome, and they make following and <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/brightkite/topics/_me_my_friends_view_could_list_also_comments_my_friends_make_other_notes">finding conversations quite difficult</a>.
</p><p>
Instead of these services, Jaiku has been the place where the interesting stuff has been happening. But lately there has been too little development, and <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/give_the_correct_status_code_when_you-re_down/">too much the failbird</a> happening for it to remain a viable platform. And so the Finnish web community has been <a href="http://www.arcticstartup.com/2008/12/15/finland-finally-moving-to-twitter/">actively looking</a> for an alternative. I think <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/">Qaiku</a>, released today, could be it.
</p><p>
So, what is cool about Qaiku?
</p><ul><li><strong>Multilingual support:</strong> I can microblog in Finnish and English, and my international friends don't need to be bothered with a language they don't understand</li>
<li><strong>Private channels:</strong> <a href="http://nemein.com/en/">our company</a> can have a private channel where to handle <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/03/03/workstreaming-the-new-face-time/">actual workstreaming</a> without leaking confidential information</li>
<li><strong>Favoriting and sharing:</strong> You can easily save interesting conversations to be accessed later, or share them in other services like <a href="http://delicious.com/">del.icio.us</a> or Facebook</li>
<li><strong>An evolving platform:</strong> <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> stagnated after <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/blog/2007/10/09/were-joining-google/">Google bought them</a>. With Qaiku there is <a href="http://www.rohea.com/">a dynamic company</a>, <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard_2-finally_legacy-free/">a cool platform</a> and many interesting ideas that will hopefully make the service evolve into interesting directions</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Sidenote:</strong> if microblogs are all about conversations, why doesn't my blog provide a commenting feature? To quote <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/02/24/why-no-comments-more-everything-buckets.html">Alex Payne</a>:
</p><blockquote>
The main reason I don’t allow comments is that I want to inspire debate. I think people do their best writing when they’re forced to defend their ideas on their own turf. It’s one thing to leave a comment on someone else’s blog, but quite another to put your argument in front of your own readers. It forces a level of consideration that, without fail, results in a higher quality exchange of ideas.
</blockquote><p>
With the same idea, instead of the comments happening on my site, I hope you will either react via your own blog, or by communicating using a microblogging service. If you link to me, I'll do my best to read it and respond :-)
</p><p>
So, if you want to discuss this post, you'll find me on <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/home/bergie/">Qaiku</a>, <a href="http://bergie.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bergie">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://brightkite.com/people/bergie">Brightkite</a>. <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/home/bergie/show/1de0cd509603edc0cd511deaa64435510d6b043b043/">This post on Qaiku</a> preferred, but I will watch couple of days for replies on the other services too.
