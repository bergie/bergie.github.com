This Christmas breaks away from an old tradition honored by a group of my friends. Since '96 we've gathered to spend the holidays together, eating and drinking vast quantities. As the <a href="http://www.suicidesurfers.org/">Suicide Surfers</a> are away, this Xmas will be different. Joe <a href="http://www.suicidesurfers.org/diaries/joe/pre-christmas_drinking.html">complains</a>:
</p><blockquote>
Relating to traditions, I just heard yesterday, that some pigs have lost their wings and adapted to the middleclass with intentions of having christmas somewhere else than in Drunkenland of Flying Pigs and Suicide Surfers. But our team keeps flying.
</blockquote><p>
All the best to the 'Surfers who are spending their holidays drunken and homeless <a href="http://www.suicidesurfers.org/diaries/joe/merry_fucking_christmas_to_all_suiciders_.html">on the beach</a>.

As I write this, Kerttu is baking and I'm waiting for the oven to free up so I can put our ham there. Yesterday we decorated the Christmas tree.
