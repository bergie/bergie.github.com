[Nemein][1] delivers browser based free software solutions. Our clients include some of the leading advertisement agencies in Finland as well as major private and public companies. Nemein is looking for a junior consultant to join our [Midgard][5] deployment team.

Skills required: 

- Must be fluent in XHTML, CSS and PHP (4 is required, 5 a bonus)
- Some CMS experience, particular systems don't really matter
- Ajax, Microformats, RSS and Web Standards knowledge would be great
- Ready to work with clients

Most of the client projects happen in the [Helsinki capital region][2]. Because of this, good command of the [Finnish language][4] is a requirement.

[Contact me][3] for more information.

__Updated:__ I thought to add that we're also ready to discuss with potential senior consultant candidates, even though the primary need is now for a junior. :-)
