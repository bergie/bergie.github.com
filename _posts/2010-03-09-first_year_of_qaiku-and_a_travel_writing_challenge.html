While it hasn't yet convinced the twittering masses, it has already proven itself as a lot more thoughtful platform for the Finnish online community, and as a valuable <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/maemo-org_is_testing_workstreaming_with_qaiku/">workstreaming tool</a>.</p>
<p>The new version looks quite nice and fresh. Notice the privacy information on the right-hand side, which is relevant as Qaiku allows channels and profiles that are private or invitation-only:</p>

<p>Technically the new version is also remarkable as it is the first major website to run fully on top of the legacy-free <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/raise_the_hammer-midgard2_mjolnir_goes_live/">Midgard2 platform</a>. So yes, every entry you see there is a GObject. And D-Bus signals fly when you post.</p>
<h2>On to the challenge, then</h2>
<p>To highlight Qaiku's threading, conversational nature I started a new <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/go/61gu/"><em>"On my travels, I have"</em></a><a href="http://www.qaiku.com/go/61gu/"> thread</a> for sharing your <em>most extraordinary travel experiences</em>. This is not on Twitter or Buzz as with Qaiku it is so easy to keep the conversation together and accessible for the future as well.</p>
<p>To contribute, <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/settings/registration/">sign up on Qaiku</a>, go to <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/go/61gu/">the thread</a> and add your experiences as a comment. If you have a link or picture to include, you can also do so. My first entry was:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/african-miracles/">seen</a> ice descend from the heavens and provide us with cold beer on a hot day in Lesotho</blockquote>
<p>Will be interesting to see what comes out of this :-)</p>
