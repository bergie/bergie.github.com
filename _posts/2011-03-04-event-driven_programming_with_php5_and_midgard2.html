<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming">Event-driven programming</a> is a paradigm that is especially familiar for GUI and JavaScript programmers. For example, it is the style used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs">Node.js</a>. In the traditional PHP space it hasn't been utilized that much, but here is an example how to do it with GObject <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/php_events/">signals as provided by Midgard2</a>.</p>
<h2>Connection events</h2>
<p>First of all we prepare a Midgard connection:</p>
<pre>// Open Midgard connection
$config = new midgard_config();
$config-&gt;read_file_at_path(ini_get('midgard.configuration_file'));
</pre>
<p>If we want to, we can also get a signal when the connection is open:</p>
<pre>// Do stuff when we get a DB connection
midgard_connection::get_instance()-&gt;connect('connected', function($connection) {
    echo "Connected, Midgard version " . mgd_version() . "\n";
});
</pre>
<p>Then we just open the actual connection:</p>
<pre>midgard_connection::get_instance()-&gt;open_config($config);
</pre>
<h2>Object IO events</h2>
<p>In Midgard event stored content object fires signals for each IO event. For example, you can get called when a new object is created (<code>action-created</code>), or when user is attempting to delete an object (<code>action-delete-hook</code>).</p>
<p>Here is a simple listener that gets fired when any article has been updated:</p>
<pre>// Whenever an article is updated we want to know about it
midgard_object_class::connect_default('org_midgardproject_news_article', 'action-updated', function($object) {
    echo $object-&gt;title . " was updated\n";
});
</pre>
<h2>Query events</h2>
<p>Database queries also have signals available. Let us prepare a query:</p>
<pre>// Query for articles
$q = new midgard_query_select(
    new midgard_query_storage('org_midgardproject_news_article')
);
$q-&gt;add_order(new midgard_query_property('metadata.created'), SORT_DESC);
</pre>
<p>Before the actual query is executed we can get called. Here we can for example add constraints to filter out information the user is not allowed to see:</p>
<pre>// When query starts executing we may add constraints to it
$q-&gt;connect('execution-start', function($executor) {
    // Only query articles with a title that starts with "Hello"
    $executor-&gt;set_constraint
    (
        new midgard_query_constraint
        (
            new midgard_query_property('title'),
            'LIKE',
            new midgard_query_value('Hello%')
        )
    );
});
</pre>
<p>Similarly we can get called after the query has executed in order to process the results:</p>
<pre>// When query is done, we may do something with the results
$q-&gt;connect('execution-end', function($executor) {
    // Increase the score of each queried article by one
    array_walk($executor-&gt;list_objects(), function($object) {
        $object-&gt;metadata-&gt;score++;
        $object-&gt;update();
    });
});
</pre>
<p>Then we just execute the query:</p>
<pre>$q-&gt;execute();
</pre>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>On my system running the code above produces the following output:</p>
<pre>$ php -c php.ini evented.php 
Connected, Midgard version 10.05.4
Hello world! was updated
</pre>
<p>Signals can be a very useful way to achieve clean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a> in your application without excessive use of class hierarchies and frameworks. <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard2/">Midgard2</a> provides these signals not only inside your own code, but also <a href="http://teroheikkinen.iki.fi/blog/midgard_workshop_at_fscons/">between processes via D-Bus</a>. Developers working in a pure-PHP environment can do something similar via the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/zetacomponents/documentation/trunk/SignalSlot/tutorial.html">Zeta Components SignalSlot library</a>.</p>
