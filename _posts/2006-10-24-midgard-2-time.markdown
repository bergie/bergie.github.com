[Midgard 1.8.0][1] is out, and so according to [the roadmap][2] we can finally start getting rid of [legacy Midgard1 features][6] to get into the nice, clean slate of [Midgard2][7].

First casualty of the cleanups is the old _MidgardArticle_ object, which Piotras just removed with the following commit message:

From now on, [MgdSchema][3] and [Query Builder][4] will be the only supported ways to access data in Midgard. [About time][5], too:
