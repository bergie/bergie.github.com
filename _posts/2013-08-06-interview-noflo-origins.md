[Here](https://vimeo.com/68285726) is a video interview of me talking about the origins of [NoFlo](https://noflojs.org/), the flow-based programming environment for JavaScript:

You've seen short pieces from this in the [NoFlo Kickstarter video](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment), but most of the material is new. This was shot when [NoFlo turned two](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/noflo-two-years/), and so I'm obviously spending some time talking about where things came from.

The video should work well to support the [hacker's perspective](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/noflo-kickstarter-launch/) of our funding campaign. Please [support us](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment) and spread the word!

*It is pretty amazing to think that since [my last post](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/noflo-kickstarter-launch/) on Friday, we've almost doubled the amount of contributions. Thanks to all the **nearly 500 backers** who have already helped us to change the world of programming!*
