<p><a href="http://apoikola.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/public-data-an-introduction-to-opening-the-information-resources/">Opening public data</a> is a hot topic in Finland at the moment. As a small experiment with the data that is available I wrote <em>buscatcher</em>, a simple N900 app that displays <a href="http://www.hsl.fi/EN/Pages/default.aspx">Helsinki trams</a> (and some buses) moving on a map in real time. This makes it easy to determine when your next tram is coming to the stop, or where it is stuck.</p>

<p><strong>Updated 2010-09-28:</strong> Buscatcher now has a stable release that is <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/buscatcher/">available from Maemo Downloads</a> with already more than 10,000 installations.</p>
<p>For other platforms, you can grab and run the application <a href="http://github.com/bergie/buscatcher">from the GitHub repo</a>. It should run on regular Linux desktops, and there have been reports of working on also platforms like the OpenMoko Freerunner.</p>
