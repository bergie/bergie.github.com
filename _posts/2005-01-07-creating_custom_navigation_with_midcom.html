One frequent question I see on <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/support-discussion/">#midgard</a> is how to customize the default navigation options shipping with the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/">MidCOM</a> template site. In my opinion, there are two options: Either stick with the existing navigation styles and customize via CSS, or roll your own in PHP.
</p>

<p>
MidCOM provides a wonderful tool called <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/concepts/midcom/specs/subsystems/nap.html">Navigation Access Point</a> (NAP) for site designers want to create their own custom navigation systems. It provides a PHP programming interface for listing the site structure. First, a bit of NAP terminology:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Node</dt>
    <dd>Directory, or subtopic in the MidCOM site structure</dd>
  <dt>Leaf</dt>
    <dd>Page, or article under a node</dd>
  <dt>Children</dt>
    <dd>Both nodes and leaves under a given node</dd>
  <dt>Root node</dt>
    <dd>The first level node, or front page of MidCOM site</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Constructing the navigation happens in two steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Figure out where you are:
    <pre>$current_node = $GLOBALS["midcom_site"]['nap']-&gt;get_current_node();</pre></li>
  <li>List the children of the node:
    <pre>$children = $GLOBALS["midcom_site"]['nap']-&gt;list_child_elements($current_node);</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>
The <em>$children</em> array contains both nodes and leaves under the <em>$current_node</em> in NAP array format which you can then traverse:
</p>

<pre>
foreach ($children as $child) {
</pre>

<p>
As we're listing all child elements from the node instead of only nodes with <em>list_nodes()</em> or leaves with <em>list_leaves()</em> we next need to instantiate correct child type for display:
</p>

<pre>
if ($child[MIDCOM_NAV_TYPE] == "node") {
    // This is a subtopic, instantiate it as node
    $node = $GLOBALS["midcom_site"]['nap']-&gt;get_node($child[MIDCOM_NAV_ID]);

    // Display the link in whatever way you want
    echo "&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=\"".$node[MIDCOM_NAV_URL]."\"&gt;".$node[MIDCOM_NAV_NAME]);&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n";
   // This is where you would place a call for listing children of the node

} elseif ($child[MIDCOM_NAV_TYPE] == "leaf") {
    // This is an article (or event or some other document type)
    $leaf = $GLOBALS["midcom_site"]['nap']-&gt;get_leaf($child[MIDCOM_NAV_ID]);

    // Display the link
    echo "&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=\"".$leaf[MIDCOM_NAV_URL]."\"&gt;".$leaf[MIDCOM_NAV_NAME]);&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
And there you have a very simple navigation listing of children under your current directory. You can easily modify this to list children of your root node by switching from <em>get_current_node()</em> method to <em>get_root_node()</em> method.
</p>

<p>
This example also doesn't check for possible content visibility settings. You can check for these using the <em>MIDCOM_NAV_VISIBLE</em> boolean in the node and leaf arrays.
</p>

<p>
<strong>In the other news</strong>, if you get error "<em>Apache2(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80</em>" when restarting Apache after addition of a new <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/installation/vhost.html">VirtualHost</a> with datagard, the problem is that you have multiple "<em>Listen 80</em>" directives in your Apache configuration. Comment out the one in <em>/etc/midgard/apache/httpd.conf</em>.
</p>

Figured this one when troubleshooting with <a href="http://blog.neoteny.com/rguerra/archives/006119.html">Robert Guerra</a> from Canada.
