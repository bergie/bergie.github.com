Photo taken with the crappy Nokia 6820 camera" />The Nibelung's Ring series is based on a combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology" title="Introduction to Norse mythology on WikiPedia">Nordic mythologies</a> and medieval German stories. A central part is played by the ring of power forged by dwarf Alberich from the stolen Rhine gold. The struggle for the ring eventually brings about Ragnarøk, the end of the Norse gods. Wagner composed the series in mid-19th century.<br /><br />While we did not appreciate the modernized, angular settings of the plays, lots of the performances were very pleasant. I especially liked Sieglinde in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Walk%FCre" title="Die Walküre on WikiPedia">Die Walküre</a> and Hagen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%F6tterd%E4mmerung" title="Götterdämmerung on WikiPedia">Götterdämmerung</a>. Wotan was also very good in the first two operas.<br /><br />Watching the whole 16 hour series in one week was quite an excercise, but we still were able to enjoy it and go for some after-opera beverages in <a href="http://www.nyt.fi/menot/ravintola?id=l100532" title="Restaurant Ateljé in Helsinki">Ateljé</a>.<br clear="all" />
