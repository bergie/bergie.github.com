Chris Shiflett has a list of [Mac OS X Annoyances][3]:

> Maximizing Is Broken.

> How hard can this be? Seriously. If you want to be different, that's cool, but not when it means being broken. When I maximize something, it should take up the whole screen. Get it? Leaving little gaps everywhere just means that I'll bring another app to the foreground when I accidentally click on it.

> Alt-Tab to a Minimized App, and It Stays Minimized.

> (Yes, I know it's really command-tab, but who says that?) There are lots of reasons why alt-tab on the Mac sucks, and this is one of them. Combine this with the fact that apps don't really close when you close them, and the result is alt-tab pollution. You switch apps, but nothing happens. Is the app closed? Is it minimized? It is just the damn Finder again?

> Too Many Option Keys.

> Function, control, alt, option, and command (which used to be called open apple and is sometimes referred to by its symbol). Which one do I use to right-click again? Which one makes the delete button delete? Surely we can get rid of one or two of these.

In the other news, I wanted to share this [photo of Karoo sunset week ago][1]  with you. The photo is taken somewhere near [Oudtshoorn][2] on [Route 62][4].
