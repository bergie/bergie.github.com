I've been totally swamped by the number of photos taken during the last eight months of travel, and am lagging badly behind on [publishing the photos][1]. To help sort things out, I've now registered a [Flickr account][2].

The [FlickrExport][3] tool makes it very easy to publish the pictures from [iPhoto][4], the application which I use to manage the pictures on my laptop:

![Uploading images via FlickrExport](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/iphoto-flickr-exporter.jpg)

Using Flickr for photo publishing fits well with my "[IT strategy][5]". I can have the photos available for three usage areas:

1. __Offline and desktop access:__ [iPhoto][8] and the [Nokia 770 image viewer][20]
2. __Sharing:__ [Flickr][2]
3. __Archival:__ Synchronizing the photos from Flickr to [Midgard][6] using [PhpFlickr][7]

I still need to implement the Flickr synchronization support into Midgard, but I trust this will be easy, especially as I already have similar thing going with [bookmarks synchronization][11] from [del.icio.us][9] and news [subscription sync][5] from [Bloglines][10].

In any case, the first trips to end up on Flickr are:

- [Cape Town and Karoo desert, 2006][12]
- [Dallas through Las Vegas to San Francisco and back, 2006][21]
- [Porto Alegre, Curitiba and Sao Paulo, 2006][19]

There are also three ancient photo sets I thought to have lost posted by [Henri Hovi][16]:

- [Atlanta, 2000][15]
- [San Francisco, 2000][13]
- [Linux Expo Madrid, 2001][14]

If you have an RSS reader or iPhoto, you can [subscribe to my picture feed][17] as a [PhotoCast][18].
