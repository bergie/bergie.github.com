I've just downloaded the [Internet Tablet OS 2006 edition Beta][1] to my [Nokia 770][2]. The software feels a lot faster, and the [new features][3] are really cool.

I even had my first chat using the thumb keyboard, and a 15 minute VoIP call with [Tigert][4].

![Maemo OS 2006 beta](/files/maemo-os-2006beta.jpg)

Very promising. I hope [Maemo Mapper][7] and the [Plazer][6] get ported to the new OS version soon.

The [OS X flashing instructions][5] work too, though the software needed for the GUI method isn't available and I had to use command line.

__Updated 2006-06-12:__ Jeff Waugh [said it well][8]: Nokia 770 is ready for the enterprise.
