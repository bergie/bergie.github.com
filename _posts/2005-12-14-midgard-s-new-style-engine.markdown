As a way to resolve the [style engine dispute][2] in the [Midgard][3] community, I asked [Jukka][4] to arbitrate. He [posted][5] his proposal for the [Midgard Style Engine V2.0][6] yesterday, and after a bit of discussion it entered [mRFC][7] [process][8]. The proposal was accepted today with 7 +1 votes from the [developers][9]. 

I'm really looking forward to seeing this happen. What I want from the new style engine, is that it would mainly work like the [old one][10], but with two new features:

* MidCOM folders must be able to override elements of site style
* Site style must be able to override elements of MidCOM components (so you
  can easily make a "global" show-article for your style template for example

__In the other news,__ it is a beautiful early winter day here in [Helsinki][1]. Sun is shining through a thin veil of clouds. There is no snow to mention yet, but the streets, buildings and trees are all covered with a thin layer of frost. When riding the bus to work across the Lauttasaari bridge half of the bay already had ice.
