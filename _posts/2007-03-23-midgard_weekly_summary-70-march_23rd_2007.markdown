[I'm][5] back from the [arctic hunting trip][4]. One week away from even the cell phone network felt really good and the [aurora borealis][6] were simply gorgeous. Now it is time to again catch up with happenings in the Midgard community...

Happenings this week
--------------------

* New Midgard-Java on its way. Jukka Zitting created [initial Java bindings for Midgard][10] back in 2005, but these did not keep up with the new APIs in Midgard core. Now an effort to revive them [has been started][11] by Piotr Pokora and Juhana Hirvilahti. There have also been rumors of [Mono bindings][12]

* Blogs from a Midgard newbie. [Jaakko Tepponen][7] is a [new addition][9] to [Finnish Teleservice Center's][8] web team. He [is blogging][7] about his 
Midgard learning experiences

* Resource calendar in PEAR. [Midgard's resource booking calendar][14] has just [hit 1.0.0 in PEAR][15]. This means it is easier than ever to manage bookable resources like meeting rooms, cars, cabins or aircraft with Midgard

* Midgard in the Finnish parliamentary elections. This year's elections had at least two candidates [powering their campaign with Midgard][13]. Midgard has lots of useful campaign features like mobile blogging and a direct marketing system capable of sending both email newsletters and SMS
