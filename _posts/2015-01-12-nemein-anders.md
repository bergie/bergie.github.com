When I flew to Tenerife to [sail across the Atlantic](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/sets/72157649721117029/) in late November, there was excitement in the air. [Nemein](http://nemein.com/) &mdash; the software company I started in 2001 with [Henri Hovi](http://www.patidure.com/) and [Johannes Hentunen](http://www.haedong-kumdo.fi/), and left later to build an [AI-driven web publishing tool](https://thegrid.io/#6) &mdash; was about to be sold.

Today, I'm happy to tell that [Nemein has been acquired](https://www.andersinnovations.com/en/news/181/anders-innovations-inc-purchases-helsinki-based-software-company-grow-international-business/) by [Anders Innovations](https://www.andersinnovations.com/en/), a fast-growing software company.

I had a videoconference this morning with Nemein's and Anders Inno's CEOs Lauri and Tomi, and it seems the team Nemein has indeed found [a good home](https://www.andersinnovations.com/en/company/people/).

Technologically, the companies are a good fit. Both companies have a strong emphasis on building business systems on top of the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. To this mix, Nemein will also bring its long background with [Midgard CMS](http://midgard-project.org/) and mobile ecosystems like [MeeGo](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/meego-diaspora/) and its successor, [Sailfish](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/jolla-sailfish/).

I wish the whole team at Anders Innovation the best, and hope they will be able to continue functioning as a champion of the [decoupled content management](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/decoupling_content_management/) idea.

Nemein has also been a valuable contributor to the [Flowhub](https://flowhub.io/) ecosystem, which I hope will continue.

*For those interested in the background of Nemein, I wrote a longish story of the [company's first ten years](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/ten_years_of_nemein/) back in 2011. I also promise to write about [The Grid](https://thegrid.io/#6) soon!*
