One often forgotten aspect in OSCOM is that involvement in the process forces CMSs to evolve through a set of positive challenges.<br /><br />For example, the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/components/net.nemein.rss">Midgard RSS aggregator</a> used to suck until there was proposal that Planet OSCOM could be implemented with <a href="http://svn.bitflux.ch/repos/public/planet-php/trunk/">another solution</a>. This lead me to improve the aggregator to a level where it works acceptably well.<br /><br />From <a href="http://www.oscom.org/get-involved/irc">#oscom</a>:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">daveb:</span> darn! doesn't seem to have category-level feeds. I'll have to fix that.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">gregor:</span> hehe<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">gregor:</span> i like how this forces us all to improve our wares<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">gregor:</span> ask bergie sometime <br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">bergie:</span> well, there is always the challenge mentality in positive sense.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">bergie:</span> &quot;Fix your solution or I'll implement it with *my* CMS&quot; <br /><br />Similar challenge from <a href="http://www.cmsreview.com/Editors/">Bob Doyle</a> to implement the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom-3/">OSCOM 3</a> site with <a href="http://www.skybuilders.com/Introductions/Intro7.html">skyWriter</a> was what lead us to the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/projects/documentation/midgard/case-oscom">Frankenstein CMS</a> concept in the first place.<br />
