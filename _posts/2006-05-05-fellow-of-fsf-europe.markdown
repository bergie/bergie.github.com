I met the [Free Software Foundation Europe][1] president [Georg Greve][2] in the [FISL 7.0][3] conference two weeks ago. Seems like the organization is doing lots of good fighting [software patents][4] and other threats here in [Europe][5].

I've been considering it for a while, and now decided to join the organization [as a fellow][6] to support its valuable work and thus help to maintain the business environment I work in.

[Sandro said it well][7]:
