We went with Kerttu to a [fencing][1] lesson for the first time yesterday. The [sabre][2] course feels interesting, and the connections to [Kendo][3], the other sword sport I've practiced are definitely visible.

A very small course at [Ylioppilasmiekkailijat][4], so we practically get private instruction.

Before Kendo I've also practiced [Iaido][5], the art of drawing the Japanese sword, and of course [Viking swordfighting][6]. Kerttu has some experience with the [foil][7].
