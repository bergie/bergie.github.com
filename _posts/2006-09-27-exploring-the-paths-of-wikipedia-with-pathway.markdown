[Pathway][1] is an OS X desktop client for the [Wikipedia][2], the free encyclopedia. It  keeps track of relations between pages you read using a [handy network map][3], and makes them searchable via [Spotlight][4]. It is also able to save the researched network of pages for later use.

Via [TUAW][5].

__On a related note:__ While there are all these applications available make the [Mac OS X][6] platform cool, I would still wish [Apple][8] would become a more responsible company by [producing greener products][7].
