<p>It is now a year since Midgard 1.0 was first released, taking the development project into public view.</p>

<p>To summarize the developments that have taken place during the year, I've written a time line to the Midgard Web site. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>The first year of Midgard</h2>

<p>It is now a year since Midgard 1.0 was first released on May 8th
1999. While the project has obviously been going on for a longer time
than that (first mention of the project is on Bergie's personal Web
site, dated April 25th 1998), the 1.0 launch was when the project
became public.</p>
<p>As it is very easy to only see where the project is now, and forget the
long process that has taken us here, I decided to put together a quick look
back into major happenings with the project in last year.
</p>
<p>To summarize, the year was one of quick growth for Midgard. We've gathered
a quite sizable community of active users and contributors, and also made
inroads to corporate acceptance of Midgard both as an important business
tool, and a product. In addition, the Midgard application server itself
has evolved much from its modest beginnings, and the development team has
had good time working on it.

<h3>March</h3>
<p><strong>Version number for Midgard 1.2.6 changed.</strong> We decided
to change the version number of Midgard 1.2.6 to 1.4. This was because it
contains too much features and newly-written code to justify it being listed
as a mere patch to the 1.2 source tree. (March 8th)
</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>SiteGroups announced.</strong> Emile announced a new system
for handling the Midgard access control data in the 1.2 architecture. This
system involved marking a 'sitegroup' information to each toplevel entry
in a Midgard database, and then allowing creation of administrator accounts
that have administrative rights only for records that are in their site
group. (March 8th)

system Repligard was being worked on very actively. Jukka Zitting assumed

</ul>
<p><strong>OOP support for Midgard records.</strong> Jukka Zitting added
a nice new feature into Midgard, enabling Midgard applications to be coded
in a much cleaner way. Now all mgd_get_record functions return methods for
modifying the records without needing to call the specific modification
functions. (March 15th)

</ul>
<p><strong>New CVS commit policy.</strong> By Emile's proposal, all new
feature additions to Midgard core should now get approved by the branch
maintainer before they are allowed to be committed in. Bug fixes and minor
improvements can of course bypass these, as can normal work on the existing
features. (March 15th)
