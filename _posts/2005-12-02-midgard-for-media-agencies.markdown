Codey from [Indian Express][3] is wondering about [aesthetics and sensibilities of CMS][4]:

> If I remember right, way back in the dotcom boom era, [someone][2] had tried convincing [Zdnet India][5] to shift to [Zope][6]/[Plone][7], since it was meant to be absolutely rocking from a geek point of view. That experiment did not go down well with the end users and it ended pretty much there. Being sexy from a geek&rsquo;s point of view is very different from what it looks like from the end-user&rsquo;s point of view. Case in point: there are a lot more of users on Blogger than [Freeflux][8], though the latter is better for a geek any given day.

> In the past four months, I have been pretty much doing the reinventing business at the new jig. I had evaluated most of the free/open source options and found none of them, other than the exception of [Midgard][1], to be good enough to fit our needs. Most were either too complex or were too simple and I would rather have my team work with a set of known problems than have them dig around nested directories of endless libraries which might or might not break every time I want to customize the site or add a new feature, which would require hacking the existing code.

He also mentions the classic Open Source support question:

> Eventually, when you take your product proposal to the management and tell them the best avenue for technical support for your solution is an IRC channel, don&rsquo;t be surprised if they totally freak out on you, which is why a lot of media organizations sign up for outrageously priced Microsoft-based solutions.

[We][9] are currently deploying Midgard for a major Finnish media agency. It would be interesting to compare notes. Oh, and there actually is [commercial support][10] available for Midgard CMS.
