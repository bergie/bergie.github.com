The web-based OpenPSA suite was originally developed in 2001 under name <a href="http://www.nemein.com/en/nemeinnet/">Nemein.Net</a>. The name was changed to OpenPSA as the application was moved to <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/development/copyrights">Open Source licensing</a>.<br /><br />The OpenPSA is suitable for consultancies and service organizations ranging from 1 to 400 users. The software package is now available in English, Finnish and Italian, and it is easy to translate to other languages. Support is available from the OpenPSA community, and commercially from Nemein.<br /><br />In addition to regular corporate usage, the OpenPSA also supports the possibility to provide the system as a hosted Application Service Provider solution. The software can be configured easily to support the service provider's brand image with colors and logos.<br /><br />OpenPSA 1.9.0 is available from <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/download/">http://www.openpsa.org/download/</a><br /><br />OpenPSA runs on the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) platform using the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard Framework</a>. Midgard is an Open Source Content Management Framework powering thousands of sites ranging from simple corporate intranets to major eGovernment portals.<br /><br />Development of the OpenPSA package is coordinated in the Tigris.org Open Source community.
