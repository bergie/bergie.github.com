I love the idea of [including a "View Source" key][1] into the [OLPC][2] keyboard:

> Having "the freedom to view the source" can seem very abstract, and having a "View Source" key makes this feature of the machines clear to the users. Imagine one of these kids visiting an Apple Store1 sometime in the future and innocently asking where the "View Source" key is. "_Let you view the source? But that's our property, it belongs to us, you can't have it._"
