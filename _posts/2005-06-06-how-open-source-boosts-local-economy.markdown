[Dave Neary][1] has published a [short essay][2] reasoning how investments in Open Source software are five or six times more valuable than investments in US-produced proprietary software:

>  And this is where all the TCO arguments coming out of Redmond fall flat on their face. Let's say, for arguments sake, that installing and supporting GNOME is 20% more expensive overall for the first 5 years you use it. It's cheaper afterwards, but play along with me for a sec.

> So when you spend $100M on Windows, $80M of that leaves the country. You get $20M working for the local economy. When you spend $120M supporting GNOME with local companies, $120M stays in the economy.

I've always thought Open Source is local business, which is why [we][4] see [franchising][3] as the viable growth option, and others [seem to agree][6].

And it is also why the Russian government is [investing][5] into building a strong local Open Source business network.
