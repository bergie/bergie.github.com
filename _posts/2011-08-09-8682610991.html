<p>Source Maps (SMAPs) are the solution, ie. files that map between the source language and the target representation. Google&#8217;s Closure compiler can generate SMAP files for it&#8217;s minified Javascript files, although currently the only tool that can read the SMAP files is the Closure Inspector, a Firebug extension. </p>

<p>Both the Mozilla and the WebKit projects have started work on supporting SMAPs in their debugging features. </p>

<p>This should remove the last concern many people have about using CoffeeScript.</p>
