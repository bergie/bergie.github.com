This week's MWS is a bit thin because of time constraints. This means some interesting things like MidCOM's new style editor will be left to MWS #70.

Happenings this week
--------------------

* Midgard talk in Norway. [Henri Bergius][4] will be talking about _Midgard CMS - building a business around an open source application developed as a joint venture between multiple companies_ in the [Open Source in Business][5] conference arranged by [Den Norske Dataforening][6] in Kristiansand on March 29th

* SyncML in OpenPsa. Thanks to [Juhana Hirvilahti][12], [latest CVS checkout][10] of OpenPsa's [SyncML plugin works][11] for synchronizing Midgard-based calendars with various mobile devices. The plugin runs inside [Funambol's SyncML framework][9]

* Multilingual content management. Midgard supports [Multilingual content management][13] very nicely in [MidCOM 2.7][14]. Jerry Jalava [reports on his implementation][15]

* No MWS next week. I'm off hunting [willow grouse][7] in [Lapland][8] next week.

About Midgard
-------------

Midgard CMS is an Open Source Content Management System built on top of the Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) platform. It provides a reliable, powerful and internationalized set of tools for building web sites and networked applications.

Midgard utilizes PHP as the web scripting language and provides integration interfaces on Java and C layers. Midgard's unique architecture enables it to provide services like single sign-on and replication. With these capabilities and the integrated full-text search system, Midgard is an excellent match for information-rich web sites and intranets.
