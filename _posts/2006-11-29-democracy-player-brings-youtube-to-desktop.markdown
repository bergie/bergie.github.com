I've just upgraded to the latest [Democracy Player][1] "Internet TV" version:

> It's pretty simple. You get a better internet video experience with Democracy Player because you can do more and you can do it more easily. Some people call it a 'TiVo for the internet' or a 'Firefox for videos'.

> Democracy Player is free, open source, and built by a non-profit organization. Our goal isn't to make money off of you. Our goal is to give you the best possible video experience.

In addition to being able to subscribe to [PodCasts][2], it can also perform searches on YouTube and Google Video, and subscribe to the search results. This way I get automatically all new [Haidong Gumdo][3] videos to my desktop for example.

Now, if only it was also available for [my 770][4]...

__Updated:__ Lifehacker has a [nice short review on Democracy Player][5].
