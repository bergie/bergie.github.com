<p>The patent abstract explains how a Web CMS works:</p>

<blockquote> A web site creation and maintenance system permits distributed control and
     centralized management of a web site. The physical implementation of the
     web site resides on a database maintained by a database administrator. The
     web site system permits a site administrator to construct the overall
     structure, design and style of the web site. This allows for a
     comprehensive design as well as a common look and feel for the web site.
     The web site system permits content for the web site to originate from
     multiple content contributors...</blockquote>

<p>This is all clearly stuff that <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard CMS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Content_Management_Systems">other CMSs</a> have been doing for a long time before the patent was filed. There was even an <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/download/1.2.5-oracle8i">Oracle port of Midgard</a> available at almost the same time the Oracle guys applied for their patent.<br /></p>
<p>Normally ludicrous American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patents">software patents</a> like this wouldn't worry me, but now that they will also start to <a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org/reference/agenda.html">apply in European Union</a>, it is a bit scarier.<br /></p>
<p>Midgard CMS was <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/developer/1999050701705NWSW">released to public</a> in May 8th 1999, and the Oracle patent was filed in March 31st 2000, so we have easily provable prior art.<br /></p>
<p>There is some <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=108743549700002&r=1&w=2">discussion on midgard-user</a> on what to do about this. One way would be to approach <a href="http://www.pubpat.org/">The Public Patent Foundation</a>. As the problem applies to all database-based content management systems and not only Midgard, it might even make sense for <a href="http://www.oscom.org/">OSCOM</a> act on it.<br /></p>
