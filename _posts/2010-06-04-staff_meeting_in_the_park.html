<p>At <a href="http://nemein.com/">Nemein</a> we have a monthly staff meeting to go through all project backlogs, new initiatives and happenings in the R&amp;D side of things. Today the weather was nice, so we decided to keep the meeting in the nearby <a href="http://www.locationguide.fi/index.php?p=location&amp;id=105">Sinebrychoff Park</a>, armed with croissants, cake and the company waterpipe. Quite pleasant change from routine!</p>
