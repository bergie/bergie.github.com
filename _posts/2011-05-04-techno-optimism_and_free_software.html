<p><a href="http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2011/05/cory-doctorow-techno-optimism/">Cory Doctorow on Locus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>To understand techno-optimism, itâ€™s useful to look at the free software movement, whose ideology and activism gave rise to the GNU/Linux operating system, the Android mobile operating system, the Firefox and Chrome browsers, the BSD Unix that lives underneath Mac OS X, the Apache web-server and many other web- and e-mail-servers and innumerable other technologies. Free software is technology that is intended to be understood, modified, improved, and distributed by its users.</blockquote>
<p>Also about the threat that centralized social networks produce:</p>
<blockquote>As a techno-optimist, I was heartened to see the role that networked technologies played in aiding activists in Iran, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain and other middle-eastern autocracies to coordinate with one another. But as a techno-pessimist, I was horrified to see activists making use of unsecured unfit systems like Facebook, which make it trivial for authorities to snoop on and unpick the structure of activist organizations.</blockquote>
