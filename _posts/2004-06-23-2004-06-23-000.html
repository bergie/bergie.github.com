Over half of the new business Nemein gets comes through the Web site, so it makes sense to put some effort into improving it. The old site was very product-focused and didn't really communicate how the company works.<br /><br />Design goals for the new site included:<br /><ul><li>Highlight solutions instead of the (Open Source) products behind them</li><li>Highlight Nemein's client list and some case studies</li><li>Explain why Open Source and Open Standards are important<br /></li><li>Replace boring press releases with more current blog postings from Nemein consultants</li><li>Showcase how Nemein works on pro bono basis with some NGOs and Open Source projects</li></ul>Some example layouts:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.lasselarvanko.com/nemein/index.htm">Front page</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.lasselarvanko.com/nemein/clients.htm">Clients and case studies</a></li><li><a href="http://www.lasselarvanko.com/nemein/solutions.htm">Solutions</a></li></ul>We would be very happy to get some feedback on the designs as <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004/2004-06-23-000.html#comments">weblog comments</a>.<br /><br />The site will be implemented with <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/cms/">Midgard CMS</a> using Web standards like XHTML and CSS.<br />
