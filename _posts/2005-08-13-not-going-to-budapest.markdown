Unfortunately I got ill after returning from the wedding in St. Petersburg, and so can't make it to Budapest for 20th.

This means I'll work still couple of days next week before heading for Poland with my motorcycle. And hopefully there will be another air race in Hungary next year.

__2005-08-24:__ My saddlebags were packed, and I was about to leave yesterday morning, when I got the message that my mother had suffered a [subarachnoid hemorrhage][1] at night. This is a very serious condition, and so I'm staying here. She will be operated tomorrow, with all wishes for her recovery...
