<p>One of the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5458382/8-things-that-suck-about-the-ipad">key complaints about iPad</a> has been its <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/03/unitasking-in-a-sandbox-windows-phone-7-series-philosophy.ars">lack of multitasking</a>. With it you can only run one application at a time, though music for example will still continue to play while you work. This is not how computers have traditionally worked, but it may not only be a bad thing. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/04/02/why-ipad-will-change-blogging-for-me/">Om Malik notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In many ways, the iPadâ€™s lack of multitasking ability makes it worthy of focusing on just the task at hand. In my brief usage of the device <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/01/27/my-early-impressions-of-apples-ipad-a-quick-hands-on-review/">at the time of its unveiling</a>, I felt a near-complete interaction with an email or a document or a web page. That was near nirvana when it came to consumption of content.</blockquote>
<p>This is close to the way I work on my <a href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/ubuntu/unr">Ubuntu Netbook</a>. When I use an application - be it a web browser or a code editor - I run it <a href="https://launchpad.net/maximus">maximized</a>, trying to rid my screen of unnecessary distractions. This is what makes the netbook <em>my work machine</em>.</p>
<p>My work machine is not a communications tool. For that I have my <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/">N900 universal communicator</a>, a second screen with beautiful multitasking capabilities. The <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/the_universal_communicator/">N900 is the hub</a> of all the potential distractions - whether you call me, IM me, or ping me on IRC, the little <a href="http://www.mynokiaworld.com/2010/01/hacking-the-n900s-notification-lights/">notification led</a> will start to blink. If I don't want to be distracted I simply leave the communicator in my bag.</p>
<p>So yes, in an increasingly distracting world, <em><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5351555_stop-multitasking-start-unitasking.html">single-tasking</a> may have a new purpose</em>.</p>
