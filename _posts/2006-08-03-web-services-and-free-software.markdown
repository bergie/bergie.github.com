It seems that [OSCON 2006][1] has sparked discussion about the relevancy of free software in the _software as service_ world that [Web 2.0][2] is taking us to. If all collaboration and data is tied to remote web servers controlled by some commercial entity, where do the [four freedoms][3] fit?

We discussed this with [Tuomas][4] in our [GUADEC feeds and synchronization talk][5] and argued that as long as [APIs and data are open][6], free software should attempt to integrate the with services.

While it means that there will be increasing reliance on [proprietary services][9], it also means that we are not confining our users to the small box that is their [desktop][7] but instead let them collaborate and share data freely.

Later, if [free peer-to-peer services][8] for similar functionalities emerge we can easily start supporting also those, as the UIs and users are already adapted to the [social way of working][10] that Web 2.0 services can facilitate.
