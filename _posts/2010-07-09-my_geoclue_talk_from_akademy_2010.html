<p><a href="http://akademy.kde.org/">aKademy 2010</a> was hosted in the sunny city of Tampere by the Finnish <a href="http://www.coss.fi/en">Centre for Open Source Solutions</a>, an organization that I'm <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/in_coss_steering_group/">a steering group member</a> of. In addition to helping a bit with the arrangements and organizing <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/meet_midgard_and_geoclue_in_akademy_2010/">the Midgard Gathering</a> there, I also gave a talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoClue">GeoClue</a>, the positioning framework for Linux desktops.</p>

</ul><p>We initially <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/synchronization-and-the-free-software-desktop-in-guadec/">started the push</a> for location-aware desktops around 2006, and now the efforts are finally starting to bear fruit. Both <a href="http://gnomejournal.org/article/70/an-introduction-to-gnome-zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a> and <a href="http://nepomuk.kde.org/">Nepomuk</a> are looking at indexing documents based on where you accessed them, <a href="http://blog.pierlux.com/2009/01/22/empathy-where-are-you/en/">Telepathy can share</a> your location with your friends, and hopefully soon also your desktop clock will switch timezones when you travel.</p>
<p>It is very cool that this development <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/making_the_gnome_desktop_location-aware/">seems to be happening</a> on both GNOME and KDE at a reasonably similar pace. GeoClue is also<a href="http://meego.com/developers/meego-architecture"> a service in MeeGo</a> and I've been told another major mobile phone manufacturer uses it. Maybe soon <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/02/apples-snow-leo/">Mac OS X will not be the only</a> platform with location APIs built in?</p>
