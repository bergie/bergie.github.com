<blockquote>So now JS is the x86 assembler of the web - not as pretty as it might be, but it gets the job done (GWT is the most hilarious case in point). It would be a classic case of worse is better except that Java only looked better from the bottom up. Meanwhile JS turned out to be pretty awesome.</blockquote>&#8212;<strong>Nick Thompson</strong>, inÂ <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebPart2MadnessOrJustInsanity.aspx">JavaScript is Assembly Language for the Web</a>
