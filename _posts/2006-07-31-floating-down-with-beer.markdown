Last saturday we participated in the [Kaljakellunta][1] - beer floating event. The day was spent in perfect weather floating with hundreds of dinghies and other improvised rafts down the [Keravanjoki][2] river from [Heureka science center][3].

Faulty oars ensured only 50% of the [Death Monkey][4] team reached the goal, but it was a really nice event in any case. Everybody was in surprisingly good mood and helpful, which is totally unheard of in typical Finnish booze-oriented events. Next year again!
