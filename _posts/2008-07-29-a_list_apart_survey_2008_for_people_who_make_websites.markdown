<a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> has <a href="http://aneventapart.com/survey2008/">a new survey</a> for people involved in web business.
</p><blockquote>
Remove the web, and billions in trade disappear. Websites enable people who canâ€™t walk to run to the store. They bring knowledge and freedom of thought to places where such things are scarce; make every person with a connection a citizen of the world; and allow every citizen to be heard.
<br /><br />Yet nobody bothered to conduct a serious inquiry into the working conditions of people who make websites until A List Apart launched its first survey in 2007.

The <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/2007surveyresults">results of the 2007 survey</a> are online.
