[Flowhub](https://flowhub.io) &mdash; the product made possible by our successful [NoFlo Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment/) &mdash; has now its own company dedicated to supporting and improving the visual programming environment.

 Last fall we bought the Flowhub and other flow-based programming assets from The Grid, and now after some paperwork we're up and running as [Flowhub UG](https://flowhub.io/about), a company registered in Berlin, Germany.

 We're also now selling the new **Pro** and **Supporter** plans, and can also provide a dedicated **on-premise** version of Flowhub. Please check out [our Plans](https://plans.flowhub.io) for more information:
