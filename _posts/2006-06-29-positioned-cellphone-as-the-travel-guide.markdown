New York Times has an article about [using cellphones as travel guides in Japan][1]:

> If you stand on a street corner in Tokyo today you can point a specialized cellphone at a hotel, a restaurant or a historical monument, and with the press of a button the phone will display information from the Internet describing the object you are looking at.

> The new service is made possible by the efforts of three Japanese companies and GeoVector, a small American technology firm, and it represents a missing link between cyberspace and the physical world.

It is great to see some examples of positioned services such as this appearing, even if they are [proprietary][3] ones. We described a [very similar scenario][5] in [our GUADEC talk this tuesday][4].

I still think that free software and free, wiki-like content is the right way to implement positioned services. Anybody can populate data to [Geonames][6] and [Wikitravel][7], making the groundwork for [much richer][8] information resources than a proprietary database can be.
