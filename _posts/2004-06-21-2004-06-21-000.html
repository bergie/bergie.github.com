On friday we ate well in the <a href="http://www.ravintolaharald.com/">Viking restaurant Harald</a>, and enjoyed some beers in the <a href="http://www.plevna.fi/">Plevna microbrewery</a>. Walking around in the Finlayson area of 19th century industrial architecture was also very nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately the <a href="http://www.keskusta.fi/keskusta/english/">Center party</a> had their national convention in the city during the weekend, and we had trouble finding accommodation. With luck we were finally able to get what was probably the last free double room in Tampere from <a href="http://www.hosteltampere.com/english/">Hostel Uimahallin Maja</a>. 54Â€ per night was quite reasonable for a large room with capacity for up to four people and view to the park near Pirkankatu.<br /><br />We started the saturday with coffee and strawberries on a pier and listening to a brass band. After that we visited the <a href="http://www.lenin.fi/">Lenin museum</a>.<br /><br />The main event for the day was visiting the <a href="http://www.tampere.fi/vapriikki/frontpage.shtml">Vapriikki</a> museum complex, where there were three very interesting exhibitions: <a href="http://www.tampere.fi/vapriikki/nayttely/samurai/english/index_en.htm">Samurai - Thousand Years of Cults and Culture</a>, <a href="http://www.tampere.fi/vapriikki/nayttely/parinaa/parinaa-en.shtml">Life in the Past Lane - Motorcycles from the 50s</a> and <a href="http://www.tampere.fi/vapriikki/nayttely/tiedonpalatsi-en.shtml">Palace of Knowledge - Treasures from Kunstkammer, St. Petersburg</a>. All three can be visited with a single ticket and are highly recommended.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/Life_in_Past_Lane.jpg" /><br /></div>
<br />All in all, a very good Tampere experience.<br />
