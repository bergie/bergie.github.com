MWS, for those who don't remember it, was a <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0524/a/mws0518.php3">Midgard Weekly Summary</a>. It was published every week from mid-1999 to sometime in 2001, first by me and later by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/a17/5b3">Ken Pooley</a> from the <a href="http://www.sewanee.edu/">Sewanee University</a>.

While MWS sometimes led to <a href="http://www.kaktus.cc/weblog/release-of-midgard-2-slightly-postponed.html">slightly premature announcements</a>, it also provided an easy way to keep on track with the Midgard project. And now that the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard-2-time.html">march towards Midgard2</a> is <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard2-is-becoming-reality.html">really on</a> and things happen at a quick pace, it might be time to revive the old Weekly Summaries.

The plan for now:
<ul><li>MWS will be published weekly on fridays</li><li>Through the week people can tag interesting things for the MWS using the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/midgardweeklysummary">del.icio.us tag "midgardweeklysummary"</a></li><li>MWS will be available on my blog, and syndicated to the "<a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates">Midgard Updates</a>"</li><li>If the demand arises, we will also make it an email newsletter</li><li>We could also have a "screenshot of the week", collected through the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/midgardweeklysummary">"midgardweeklysummary" tag on Flickr</a>.</li></ul>Inspiration for reviving the summaries came from <a href="http://desdeamericaconamor.org/blog/node/334">Quim Gil's Maemo Selecta!</a> update.
