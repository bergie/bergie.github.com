A new layout for the Grey Wolves.

Now that there is a chance to get the tech needed to create and run [the Grey Wolves' site](http://www.greywolves.org) ready, we have finally started redesigning the outlook to a more working system.

So far it has got quite nice reviews from other Web Team members, and hopefully this layout will be the one used finally on the site. Actually it even got some new people to get involved in the process of researching the best ways for us to use web for announcing and generic information distribution. Now I just hope that we'll get to create the actual site soon...
