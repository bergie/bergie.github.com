<a href="http://blog.ssokolow.com/archives/2011/05/07/a-python-programmers-first-impression-of-coffeescript/">CoffeeScript through the eyes of a Python developer</a><br/><blockquote>

<p>﻿CoffeeScript is a simple, clean, fast language which compiles to JavaScript, either at build time, with a caching framework plugin on the server, or at runtime in the browser.</p>

<p>The syntax looks like a cross between Python and Haskell and, generally speaking, is used similarly enough to Python that you’ll have little trouble picking it up and using it comfortably.</p>

<p>It does have a few of what non-Ruby programmers will consider distasteful warts, but for the most part, it’s an elegant and delightful language.</p>
