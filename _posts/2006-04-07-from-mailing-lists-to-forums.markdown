The [Midgard mailing lists][1] have been offline for a while because their hosting provider has been having some issues. To fix the problem we decided to move from regular email lists to an online forum powered by the [net.nemein.discussion component][2].

Currently the forums are [publicly readable][5], but posting requires [registration][3] and [logging in][4].

Switching from mailing lists to online forums is a big cultural change for the community. To make the change easier, we will soon be adding alternative access options to the forum contents including RSS and email subscription.

In addition to the email subscription system I'm working on, new software coming from this migration was a mbox-to-forum converter to the [Exorcist][6] package.

__Updated 14:14Z:__ There are now RSS feeds available for the [user forum][8] and the  [developer forum][7].
