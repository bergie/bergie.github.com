According to the [DesktopLinux.com article][1], Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, and Thailand have each now ordered a million 100$ laptops for use in education.

> The OLPC aims to distribute -- free of charge -- millions of Linux-based laptop computers, complete with their own power sources, to needy children in developing countries around the world.

[One Laptop Per Child][2] is a very interesting project aiming to use Free Software to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and third world countries.

Makes me wonder though where [industrialized countries][4] stand with this. Even if the price was doubled to subsidize third world deployments, it would still be reasonably cheap compared to printing millions of textbooks every year. [Ministry of Education][3], are you listening?

__Updated 2006-08-03:__ Apparently the information about orders was [premature][5]. Hopefully it will still happen, though.
