The latest issue of <a href="http://monocle.com/">Monocle</a> just dropped in my mailbox. The cover story this time is <a href="http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Web-Articles/QoL-Trailer/">quality of life</a> in various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city">global cities</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki">Helsinki</a> did quite well, being 5th on the list. Defects listed with the city included shops being closed on Sundays and low <a href="http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Immigration+maintains+urban+population+growth+in+Finland/1135227401313">immigration levels</a>. From my view the city is doing <a href="http://www.hs.fi/english/article/International+idea+competition+to+for+future+structure+of+Helsinki+region+/1135223789090">many things right</a>, including <a href="http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/helsinki-metro/">increasing</a> <a href="http://www.kotimaki.com/rautatie/tomorrow/marja.shtml">rail</a> <a href="http://www.hel.fi/wps/portal/HKL_en/Artikkeli?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/en/Helsinki+City+Transport/Current+and+News/Renewals+in+Line+Network+for+Southern+Helsinki+Mid-August">transport</a> and transforming the old harbour areas into interesting new neighborhoods. The <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/historical_helsinki-malmi_airport_threatened/">policy on airports</a> sucks, though.

Some of my favourite European cities did quite well, too, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> being 4th and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona">Barcelona</a> 15th. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">Istanbul</a> however showed up 3rd on the "Winning Losers" list. With Istanbul complaints were around <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/03/europe/letter.php">religious tensions</a> and <a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=26852">freedom of expression</a>. I could add the often very <a href="http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=60671">long travel times</a> between various parts of the city, though they're likely to get improved once the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmaray">Marmaray tunnel</a> is complete. However, I wouldn't mind living in any of these three cities some day. Maybe once our <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/scrum_in_management_of_a_small_software_consultancy/">working model</a> is more <a href="http://matthewbass.com/2008/06/13/nomadic-programming/">nomadistic</a>...
