The News system of Bergie's website is back online, after being broken by new version of Midgard.

The Midgard web publishing system changed the way its URLs work in order to make the pages easier to mirror to normal web servers.

This caused the News script in my website to break, as it used the old Midgard URL system.

But as I am finally learning to write (admittedly still simplistic) Midgard applications, this was not as big a problem. I just had to be bothered by the system being broken enough to rewrite it.

Also, at the same time, the news page moves from its old location to reside under the "site" hierarchy of my website. This is because of some architectural changes in the way my pages function.
