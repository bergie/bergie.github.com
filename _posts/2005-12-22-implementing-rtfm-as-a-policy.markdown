[We][1] are now doing some reorganization in cooperation with the support provider [Protie][2]. Part of the change is to split [our team][3] more clearly between [OpenPsa][4] development and [CMS deployments][5]. To make things easier and support the community [documentation efforts][6], we're planning to implement a new policy: [RTFM][7].

> RTFM is an initialism for the statement "Read The Fucking Manual". This instruction is usually given in response to a question which the responder knows or believes can be answered easily by reading relevant documentation, and suggests that the inquirer may be wasting people's time.

The idea with __RTFM__ is that when the guys from the deployment team need to ask something, we have to be able to reply by giving them an URL in [Midgard Wiki][8] or [OpenPsa Documentation][9].

As lots of stuff is not available in the online docs, this means that we will have to add it to be able to send a link. Will be interesting to see how well this works.
