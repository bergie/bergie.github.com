<p align="baseline">What makes this tragedy a bit more personal is that I spent six hours in the terminal on my February <a href="http://www.routamc.org/journal/Glimpse%20of%20Africa/">trip to South Africa</a>, and was quite impressed by the futuristic architecture:</p>

<blockquote>
An architect in Cambridge, Brad Bellows, is quoted as saying: &quot;We don't want to purge the world of future Golden Gate bridges, Notre-Dame cathedrals, and Concordes. It should not be lost in the aftermath of its failure that Terminal 2E was a gorgeous piece of work.&quot;

<p>Having read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1856278638/qid=1085579811/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i5_xgl14/103-8237630-5725417?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Lost Europe: Images of a Vanished World</a> last week I can only echo that. So much great architecture gets destroyed either in wars or in the name of progress.<br />
