I've just committed the new login screen styling for [Midgard CMS][1] into the SVN repository.

![MidCOM 2.6 login screen](https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/midcom-2-6-login-screen-small.jpg)

The login screen was designed by [Piippunaakka][2] with CSS by [Joonas Bergius][3]. It will ship in MidCOM 2.6.0beta3 for testing purposes, and will be bundled into [Midgard 1.8][4] final release.
