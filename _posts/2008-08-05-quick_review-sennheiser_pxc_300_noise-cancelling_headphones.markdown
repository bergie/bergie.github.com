<br />As a <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/bergie">frequent traveler</a>, I've been long thinking about getting proper <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/headphones/sennheiser-pxc-300/4505-7877_7-31296835.html?tag=txt">noise-cancelling headphones</a>. Now, en-route to a <a href="http://haedong-kumdo.org/news/1211234116.html">Haedong Kumdo seminar in Ireland</a> I managed to forget my usual headphones home, and so it was time to take the plunge.
</p><p>
Here is a quick review:
</p><ul><li>First impression: wow, quite a lot of cable to carry around. I got used to too good with the Bluetooth headphones which my <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/iphone_personal_computer.php">iPhone 3G</a> unfortunately <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=5856094">doesn't support</a></li>
<li>The noise cancelling unit is a bit big, but clips into belt and runs on two AAA batteries</li>
<li>Sitting next to the engine, there is still quite a strong background hum, but still I'd estimate at least half of the noise is gone</li>
<li>If I push the headphones on my ears, most of the hum disappears too</li>
<li>I was amazed how loud planes are when I took the headphones off to buy lunch from the stewardess</li>
<li>The bag that came with the headphones is very handy, and includes adapter for plugging the headphones into in-flight entertainment systems</li>
</ul><p>
All in all, the headphones are bit pricey, but will increase comfort of regular air travel quite a lot.
