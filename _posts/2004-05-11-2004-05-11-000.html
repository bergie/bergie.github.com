Other companies are finding that commoditization is a great weapon to use against an archenemy. Sun Microsystems, for instance, is heavily promoting StarOffice, its inexpensive open source alternative to the ubiquitous Microsoft Office. Sun knows that if it can commoditize basic business apps, it can begin to break Redmond's stranglehold on the PC desktop.

<p>The same pattern can be seen in the content management scene, where <a href="http://www.oscom.org/">Open Source CMSs</a> are driving the prices of a CMS solution down. This is visible at least in Finland, where several proprietary CMS vendors seem to be ready to forgo any license prices to just distribute their app.<br /></p>
<p>Hopefully our <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/">OpenPSA</a> package can do the same to the Professional Services Automation scene.<br /></p>
