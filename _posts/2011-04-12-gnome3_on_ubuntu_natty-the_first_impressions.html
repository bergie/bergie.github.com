<p>So, <a href="http://gnome3.org/">GNOME3</a> was released last week. I was then <a href="http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/IKSDevelopersWorkshopSaarbr%C3%BCcken">away in Saarbrucken</a>, working on some linked data stuff, and so didn't have the courage to upgrade. But today I took the leap and installed both <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/beta">Ubuntu Natty beta</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/gnome3/+packages">GNOME3 from the PPA</a>. Now my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">11" MacBook Air</a> finally has the setup I originally intended for it.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2011/04/ars-reviews-gnome-30-a-shiny-new-ornament-for-your-linux-lawn.ars">Ars Technica says</a>, GNOME3 feels very solid for a first release. Some first impressions:</p>
<ul><li>Window management by dragging them to the edges is very handy</li>
<li>Notifications allow me to focus on the things I'm doing at the moment, but still allow for easy conversations when I want them</li>
<li>Finding, launching and managing applications is easy. <em>Apple key -&gt; type some characters -&gt; enter</em> starts an application</li>
<li>Wake-up from suspend and acquiring wireless are very snappy, though I guess this is mostly thanks to Natty and not the desktop</li>
<li>The monochrome top bar is beautiful and has the necessary functionalities. I don't really miss the panel applets</li>
<li>In general the desktop stays out of the way and lets me focus on what I'm working on</li>
</ul><div>Then the weird stuff:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>The window decorations are humongous, especially as they have very little use in the window management paradigm. This really hurts the usable vertical space</li>
<li>I really miss the <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2010/11/ubuntu-1104-desktop-will-get-global.html">global menus from Unity</a>. Though with modern applications I might be even happier with no menus at all</li>
<li>The system font looks a bit squished, but I guess that is because of my X settings</li>
<li>I haven't figured out how to remove the unnecessary accessibility menu from the top bar</li>
</ul><p>Anyway, great work from the team! I hope the annoyances can be fixed in due course, and I'm looking very much forward to hacking with Midgard and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Gjs">JavaScript-based desktop</a>.</p>
