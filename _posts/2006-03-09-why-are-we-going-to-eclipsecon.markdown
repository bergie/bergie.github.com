There is a post on [Tapestry plug-in weblog][1] analyzing the participants of the [EclipseCon Open Source Pavilion][2]. The post is a bit doubtful on [Midgard's][3] participation:

> On surface this is a -1, irrelavent. But, looking deeper they are a showcase for the [PHPEclipse][4] plug-in. +1

Of course Midgard as a [C and PHP][15] project doesn't directly have anything to do with [Eclipse][5]. However, there are several points where the two connect and those are something I wish to [demonstrate there][6]:

* PhpEclipse is the [default development tool][7] for building [MidCOM components][8]
* Midgard supports the [Java Content Repository][9] standard and so could be manageable using the [Eclipse JCR plug-ins][10]
* [OpenPsa][11], the Midgard ERP package is getting integrated with [Digital Business Ecosystem][12] and [DBE Studio][13] for Eclipse

In the other news, somebody in the event will be lucky enough to win a cool [Midgard messenger bag][14] designed by Tony Lee
