It is not only sauna, cold winters and Koskenkorva that sets us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finns">Finns</a> apart, apparently:

One is between the Finns (light blue, upper right) and other Europeans. It arose because the Finnish population was at one time very small and then expanded, bearing the atypical genetics of its few founders.
