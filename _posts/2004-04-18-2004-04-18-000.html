The <a href="http://www.oluthuone.com/ravintolat/sailors.php">Sailor's</a> pub, situated in the trendy Herttoniemenranta suburb was a very good choice. We were able to sit in sunshine and watch the boats in the harbour, while enjoying our H.Uppmanns. Before going to the pub I also got to see my friend's new <a href="http://www.routamc.org/gallery/spring-2004/IMG_4558.html">Fabarm shotgun</a>.<br /><br />After the pub visit there was time for cruising leisurely in the suburbs. I eventually ended up watching some aircraft landings at the <a href="http://www.helsinki-vantaa.fi/lentoasemat/">Helsinki-Vantaa</a> airport and then the exhibitions at the <a href="http://www.ilmailumuseo.fi/">Finnish Aviation Museum</a>.<br /><br />The museum visit was very nice, with lots of nostalgic planes and photos from the pioneering era of aviation, and the second world war. I was the only customer and it was interesting to wander in the huge, quiet halls filled with all kinds of airplanes.<br /><br />Having seen the museum, I continued my sunday cruise to the twisty backroads of Vantaa. After some enjoyable riding it was time to return back to Helsinki, and enjoy ice cream in the <a href="http://www.nba.fi/en/seurasaari_openairmuseum">Seurasaari</a> open air museum.<br /><br />To complete the picture, I'm going next to the <a href="http://www.finnkino.fi/teatterit/default.asp?f=57&s=49&">Tennispalatsi</a> megaplex to see if any tickets are available to to premiere of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/">Kill Bill vol. 2</a>, and maybe watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335438/">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a>.<br /><br />Some pictures from the ride are on the <a href="http://www.routamc.org/gallery/spring-2004/?startfrom=16">Routa MC</a> site.<br />
