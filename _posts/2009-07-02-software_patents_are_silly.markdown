<a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2009/07/02/why-i-disagree-with-rms-concerning-mono/">Dave Neary summed this up</a> well:
</p><blockquote>
...I fundamentally disagree with discouraging someone from pursuing a technology choice because of the threat of patents. In this particular case, the law is an ass. The patent system in the United States is out of control and dysfunctional, and it is bringing the rest of the world down with it. The time has come to take a stand and say “We don’t care about patents. We’re just not going to think about them. Sue us if you want.”
</blockquote><p>
With <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a> we <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004-06-17-000/">have prior art on some software patents</a>. Software patents only promote big multinational monopolies, and therefore are <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/eu_agriculture_ministers_threaten_again_with_software_patents/">against the interests of both Europe and the Free Software movement</a>. They're silly, <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/no-to-european-software-patents/">don't apply here</a>, and therefore the only rational response is to ignore them.
