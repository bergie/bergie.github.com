Here is <a href="http://nemein.com/en/">my company's</a> view on how we see ourselves proceeding.
</p><p>
<strong>Baseline:</strong> <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard/1.8">Midgard 1.8</a>, <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/view/midcom_2-8-0_released.html">MidCOM 2.8</a> and PHP 5.2
</p><p>
At least in our company we're trying to consolidate all customers to these version numbers. MidCOM 2.8 is a very capable (if heavy) platform that we will be able to support for a long time. It is also important, as...
</p><p>
<strong>Next step:</strong> <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard/1.9">Midgard 1.9</a>, MidCOM 2.9 and PHP 5.2
</p><p>
Having consolidated sites to MidCOM 2.8 and PHP 5.2, it will be very easy to migrate to Midgard 1.9 (PHP4 not supported). While Midgard API changes somewhat (Exceptions, Midgard_Connection) between 1.8 and 1.9, MidCOM 2.9 (currently called &quot;trunk&quot;) is able to hide that from site builders.
</p><p>
<strong>Mid-term:</strong> Midgard 1.9, <a href="http://www.l.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbergie.iki.fi%2Fblog%2Fsome_plans_for_midcom_3.html&amp;ei=UDHZR5aBEIv2wwGA6KGsCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQ3rNK3au_rKV9pFWGCdlDhlJodw&amp;sig2=pmP2wAex6bqrh1IJKbfCZA">MidCOM 3.0</a> and PHP 5.2
</p><p>
The main reasons to switch from Midgard 1.8 to Midgard 1.9 are performance, new installer and the ability to run MidCOM 3 alongside MidCOM 2.8. While MidCOM 3 requires complete site rewrite from 2.8/2.9, this phase makes migrations and running sites with both versions on same server possible.
</p><p>
<strong>Long-term:</strong> <a href="http://trac.midgard-project.org/milestone/Midgard%202.0">Midgard 2.0</a>, MidCOM 3.0 and <a href="http://www.dotvoid.com/view.php?id=57">PHP 6</a>
</p><p>
Once a server has completely migrated from MidCOM 2.x sites onwards, it will be possible to make the final jump to the full new generation Midgard platform.
