The conversion was done by <a title="Nemein, Finnish Midgard Consultancy" href="http://www.nemein.com/">Nemein</a> consultant <a title="Henri Kaukola's home page" href="http://www.kaukolaweb.com/">Henri Kaukola</a>. The old site had been powered by the NemeinNavBar system. Conversion to MidCOM was handled using my <a title="nnb2midcom conversion script sources" href="http://www.nehmer.net/~bergie/nnb2midcom.txt">nnb2midcom.php</a> script. MidCOM offered several advantages to the old setup:<br /><ul><li>Clean, file-like URLs</li><li>&quot;Edit this page&quot; integrated authoring tool</li><li>Availability of different <a title="MidCOM Component download page" href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/components/">components</a>, or site features</li><li>Easily configurable metadata fields for content<br /></li></ul>As the site was going to be upgraded anyway, we took the opportunity to convert Helia's layout to <a title="Case study on making microsoft.com table-free" href="http://www.stopdesign.com/articles/throwing_tables/">table-free</a> XHTML and CSS. This reduced the size of the site front page from 16,88KB to 9,37KB, a 45% saving. Approximately same saving should apply to all pages on the site.<br /><br />The new layout should help with page download times, server load and scaling the site down to mobile devices and screen readers.<br />
