    Lots of Content Management Systems strive to <a href=
    "http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000058.php">
    provide meaningful URLs</a>. With CMSs meaningful URLs usually
    mean mapping the internal content structure of the system to a
    filesystem-like tree hierarchy, which has the downside tying
    the URLs into the site structure.
</p>
<p>
    When the site structure is reordered the links can easily
    <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980614.html">be
    broken</a>. While sensible CMS deployments set up redirectors
    for most popular URLs, and a user-friendly <a href=
    "http://www.plinko.net/404/custom.asp">404 not found page</a>,
    it is still an annoyance to people linking to the pages. As
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URIs don't
    change</a>, these solutions are not enough.
</p>
<p>
    Here the blog world comes to help by <a href=
    "http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/06/on_permalinks_and_paradigms.shtml">
    having introduced</a> the <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">PermaLink concept</a>.
    PermaLink is short for Permanent Link, a link that the CMS or
    blog system being used ensures will remain current. In blog
    systems these PermaLinks are often displayed as a link on the
    page, or identified with the pound (#) sign. PermaLinks are
    also utilized in syndication specifications like <a href=
    "http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt">
    RSS 2.0 element</a>.
</p>
<p>
    While this helps with aggregation and blog linking, it doesn't
    make linking permanently to CMS-powered sites any easier. On
    most real sites powered by a CMS it is not desirable to display
    words like "PermaLink" in the page templates. So what is needed
    instead is a more invicible, and machine-readable solution.
</p>
<p>
    Again, the blog world has already come up with a solution for
    this. Several blog systems utilize <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.1.2">tags</a>
    for <a href=
    "http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2003/07/22-rssautodetect/read">
    RSS autodetection</a>. For example, the Firefox browser looks
    for this tag and <a href=
    "http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/07/13/rss-feed-integration-in-firefox">
    enables feed subscription</a> if it has been detected.
</p>
<p>
    In similar vein, I would like to propose usage of tags for
    making PermaLinks machine-readable. Here's what I added to
    <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard CMS</a>
    today:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;link rel="bookmark" href="&lt;PermaLink URL&gt;" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    When embedded into the HTML block this way, it is already
    recognized by Mozilla and displayed in the "Page Info" window:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="450" height="151" border="0" title=
    "PermaLink address shown in Mozilla Firefox" alt=
    "mozilla-autodetect.jpg" src=
    "https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/mozilla-autodetect.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
    Preferably different authoring and content management tools
    would become aware of this tag and start looking for it. When
    the user would insert a link to a document, the authoring tool
    could make a HTTP GET request to the URL, and if the PermaLink
    could be found from there link to it instead. That way
    permanent linking would be completely transparent to website
    authors.
