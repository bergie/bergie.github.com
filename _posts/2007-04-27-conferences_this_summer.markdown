This summer I will be at these events:

* June 1st - 3rd: __[Midgard Developer Meeting][1]__, Helsinki, Finland<br />
  Discussion about the upcoming Midgard 2 release

* July 14th - 15th: __[The State of the Map][2]__, Manchester, UK<br />
  Speaking with [Andrew Turner][3] about [GeoClue][5] and learning more about [OpenStreetMap][4]

* July 15th - 19th: __[GUADEC][6]__, Birmingham, UK<br />
  Speaking with Andrew Turner and [Tuomas Kuosmanen][7] about [GeoClue and geodata standards][8]

Between these, some GeoRSS aggregation initiatives and the [GeoClue for Maemo Google SoC project][10] that I [mentor][9], the summer will be quite geographically oriented. Which sounds like fun :-)
