<blockquote>The Bauhaus’s philosophy was that form should follow function and all other distractions and decoration should be avoided. It wanted space to be experience for its purity, stripped off all the ‘dirt’ and clutter of decor. This is something that’s been happening recently in the field of visual interaction design.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/04/18/the-ixd-bauhaus-what-happens-next/">Interaction Design&#8217;s Bauhaus moment</a> talks about the recent trend towards reductionist design. I find the same connects well with the trend of simpler ways to build software, like Functional Programming and JavaScript.
