<br /><a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> has an interesting story on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/395171/how-your-location+aware-iphone-will-change-your-life">how location-aware iPhone will change things</a>:
</p><blockquote>
There's a lot of speculation as to what we can expect from next week's iPhone announcements, but there's one thing you can be sure of: The iPhone's location-aware features will change your life. Whether that means pinpointing your location on a Google Map (which iPhones already do), tracking your friends when you go out, or giving you a heads-up on the best place to eat within a three-block radius, the location-aware future is bright.
</blockquote><p>
The scenarios described in the story are very similar to what <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue#head-32194acec6df299bec227dd0838960febe2d853b">we've been discussing</a> regarding <a href="http://geoclue.freedesktop.org/">GeoClue</a>, the framework for making mobile Linux devices location-aware.

With <a href="http://gizmodo.com/384232/more-iphone-2-details-3g-gps-back-in-glossy-black-and-a-little-fatter">iPhone</a> pushing innovation it is very important that mobile Linux environments like <a href="http://www.gnome.org/mobile/">GNOME Mobile</a>, <a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo</a> and <a href="http://qtopia.net/modules/devices/">QTopia</a> pick up the ball and start making location-aware solutions powered by <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/why-the-iphone-doesnt-need-gps/">more than just GPS</a>. GeoClue can <a href="http://folks.o-hand.com/~jku/geoclue-docs/">help there</a>.
