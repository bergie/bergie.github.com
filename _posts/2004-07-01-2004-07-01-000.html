<br />The photos still need to be titled and added to appropriate travel journal entries, but that might have to wait until I return from the <a href="http://www.routamc.org/journal/To%20the%20Black%20Sea/">Black Sea</a>.

<br />134 of my 391 photos are now available. The rest are quite repetitious and will probably remain offline. All photos are of course available under the <a href="http://www.routamc.org/updates/routamc-cc.html">Creative Commons license</a>.<br />
