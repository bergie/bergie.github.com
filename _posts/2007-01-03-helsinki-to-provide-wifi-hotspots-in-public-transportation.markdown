The [City of Helsinki][3], despite some of [its failings][1], is  also doing some cool stuff. Examples include promotion of greener rail traffic, and [increasing number][7] of [free WiFi hotspots][2]. 

So far these have been stationary, but now [Helsinki City Transport][4] is piloting WiFi in buses and trams. [Helsingin Sanomat reports][5]:

> Some Helsinki buses and trams will deploy wireless internet access in January. Trams and buses providing access can be recognized by the WLAN signs at the doors.

> ...

> According to Helsinki City Transport planning director __Ville Lehmuskoski__ HCT is ready to increase wireless connectivity quickly in its vehicles if the pilot is successfull.

Great! Now the only question remaining is how to mark a moving hotspot [in Plazes][6].
