<a href="http://flors.wordpress.com/">Quim</a> wrote earlier on <a href="http://desdeamericaconamor.org/blog/node/393">why red hearts matter in maemo news</a>. The red hearts are important as they <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/calculating_news_item_relevance/">bring important news items forward</a> in the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/maemo_social_news_launched/">maemo social news aggregator</a>. But sometimes there are also news items that are not at all relevant to the <a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo</a> community. To solve the problem with them we've now added a burying option:

<img src="/files/socialnews-favbuttons.png" height="97" width="132" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Socialnews-Favbuttons" />

When you click the "Thumbs down" icon the item will enter a recalculation queue, and will soon disappear from the social news main page. It will of course remain in the news feed it came from, so everything for example coming from Planet maemo subscriptions will stay there.

The item will also be marked as buried for you:

Also related to the <a href="http://maemo.org/news/">Social News service</a> is that the <a href="http://maemo.org/news/best">best of maemo news highlights</a> is now available for browsing. Go and check out the most popular items related to the project!
