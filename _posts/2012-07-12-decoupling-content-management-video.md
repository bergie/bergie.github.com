Our concept of [Decoupled Content Management](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/decoupling_content_management/), together with the [VIE](http://viejs.org/) and [Create.js](http://createjs.org/) is really taking off. I've spent [in various conferences](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/decoupled_content_management_on_tour/) this summer speaking about them.

Here is [a video](http://vimeo.com/45633052) from the talk I gave in the [IKS Salzburg Workshop](http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/Workshops/Salzburg2012) last month. It is quite a lot shorter than the more comprehensive talks like the one in Symfony Live, but should introduce the ideas pretty well:

Those interested in the background of all this may also enjoy [this video](http://vimeo.com/12914595) where we're talking about the concepts behind Create.js together with the [Aloha Editor](http://aloha-editor.org/) team back in summer 2010 when things were just getting started.

IKS has also published a video of [Sebastian Germesin's](http://sebastian.germes.in/) [VIE tutorial](http://vimeo.com/45639196) from the same event:
