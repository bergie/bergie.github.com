I'm really sorry for the state my site has been in for the last month or so. The server I'm hosted on is really starting to decay.

As good news, I will be testing a new virtual server from [Kotisivut.com][1] next week, and will hopefully be able to move there soon. I'll be sharing the new Midgard server with at least [kaktus.cc][2]
