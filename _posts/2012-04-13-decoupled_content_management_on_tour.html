<p>It seems the idea of <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/decoupling_content_management/">Decoupling Content Management</a> is gaining momentum. On the user interface side, many projects have already adopted the <a href="http://viejs.org/">VIE</a> interaction framework and widgets from <a href="http://createjs.org/">Create</a>, and in the content repository space projects like <a href="http://phpcr.github.com/">PHPCR</a> move forward and there are also interesting new ideas like <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/labs/oak/README.txt">Apache Oak</a>.</p>
<p>While much of this has been made possible by the <a href="http://www.iks-project.eu/">IKS project</a>, it is also great to see the wider CMS community getting more active in the space. Part of this momentum is also apparent in how many communities want to learn more about these ideas.</p>
<p>Here are some upcoming events where decoupled CMS will be present:</p>
