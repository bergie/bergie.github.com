We get asked often about the background of the name __Nemein__ we chose for our [Open Source consultancy][1]. As Malarkey is [running a thread][2] about this, I took the time to write the explanation down:

> We went with _Nemein_, an ancient Greek word for "_to distribute, manage_" for our consultancy.

> The idea was to build Open Source [software][4] to enable organizations to manage their increasingly distributed and mobile, nomadistic workforce and projects.

> And of course, nemein.com was free :-)

Nemein has common origin with [nemesis][3], and is connected with the word _nomad_.

Here's the original company logo:

![Nemein Solutions - Enabling Mobile Collaboration][5]

Would I choose a different name if I were to start the company today? 

Probably yes. The name should be more easily pronounceable ("Nemain? Nimein? Nemes?") and should start with an A. It could also reflect the business we're in in a less cryptic way. 

But anyway, _Nemein_ has already quite good recognition in Finland and sounds different from the competitors, so I guess it isn't too bad.

At least it isn't directly from the [New Media Company Generator][6]...
