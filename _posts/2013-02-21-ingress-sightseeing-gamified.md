Lately we've been spending evenings out playing [Ingress](http://ingress.com), the new location-based augmented reality game from Google's Niantic Labs.

You end up discovering new things about your home city, as well as the other cities you visit. The small statues and fountains, the historical buildings. Often it is enough to go where portals are to see all the interesting things. And as you walk around, the connections between the different parts of a city become a lot more apparent than when taking the metro.

If something interesting you find isn't yet a portal, you can also snap a picture and send it to Niantic Labs. This way it may become a portal later for others to discover what you've seen!

## The gear

In theory, the only thing you need for playing Ingress is a reasonably fast Android phone and a data plan.
