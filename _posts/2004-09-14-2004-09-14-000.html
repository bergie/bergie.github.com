<p>In addition, there is now a new promotional website, <a href="http://spreadfirefox.com/community/" title="Spread Firefox!">spreadfirefox.com</a> in beta release. <a href="http://spreadfirefox.com/community/?q=node/view/88" title="Spread the word on Firefox">Spread the word</a>.<br /></p>

<p>Upgrading both Firefox and Thunderbird from earlier releases went quite painlessly on my Mac OS X box. And now Thunderbird has a cool RSS reader so following my blog will be easier than ever ;-)<br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updated 2004-09-15 18:48:</span> The Firefox upgrade actually had some issues. It refused to open a browser window after the installation. Only deleting my profile using the Firefox Profile Manager helped.<br /></p>
