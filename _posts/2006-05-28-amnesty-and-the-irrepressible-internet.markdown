[Amnesty International][1] is campaigning [against Internet censorship][2]:

> Chat rooms monitored. Blogs deleted. Websites blocked. Search engines restricted. People imprisoned for simply posting and sharing information.

> The Internet is a new frontier in the struggle for human rights. Governments – with the help of some of the biggest IT companies in the world – are cracking down on freedom of expression. 

> Amnesty International, with the support of The Observer, is launching a campaign to show that online or offline the human voice and human rights are impossible to repress.

You can [sign the pledge][3] that will be presented in an UN conference this November. You can also join to the effort by [publishing][4] irrepressible fragments of censored material on your own site.
