My [DBE tutorial][1] in [F&oacute;rum GNOME][2] went quite well. Learning from the translation issues in Saturday's [Midgard tutorial][3], this time the presentation was held in the main auditorium of [LatinoWare Mercosul][4] with [simultaneous translation][5].

The presentation generated lots of interest in the [Digital Business Ecosystem][6], and I was asked to give a short briefing on the subject for students of the [ESEEI university][7] together with [Nathan Wilson][8] from [DreamWorks][9].

[Digital Business Ecosystem slides in English (392KB PDF)](/files/OpenPsa_DBE_20051127-en.pdf)

DBE was also [being presented][11] in the [World Summit on the Information Society][10], and the [Brazilian][13] delegation including Minister of Culture [Gilberto Gil][12] got interested in bringing the concept to their country. The [Free Software movement][14] is very strong in the area, and it will be interesting to watch where they will be able to take DBE.

Some local developers [are already waiting][15] for a stable [OpenPsa 2][16] release to become available so that they can start experimenting the the [DBE connectivity][17]. [One Brazilian blog][18] has a photo of me discussing DBE with Nathan and [Jon "Maddog" Hall][19] after my speech.

__Updated 2005-11-30:__ I will be presenting DBE also in [SOLISC][20] tomorrow.

Also there are [two][21] [photos][23] of my talk on the [LatinoWare][22] site.
