<p>Google launched a <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/01/finding-places-near-me-now-is-easier.html">new mobile web service called Near Me Now</a> that can recommend things like restaurants, bars and ATMs near you. This uses <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/browser_geolocation_without_gps-quite_accurate_enough/">browser geolocation</a> to provide only <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#inferring_context_from_the_environment">results relevant</a> to where you are.</p>

<p>The idea is quite good: to replace business directories like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> or <a href="http://eat.fi/">eat.fi</a> with something that is easily accessible from <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google's homepage</a> and uses Google's great relevancy algorithms.</p>
<p>However, the implementation is not quite there yet. My main gripe is that they implemented this using browser sniffing so that the feature can be accessed <em>only</em> with iPhones and Android devices. Even though I'm using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900">N900</a>, a mobile device that has GPS and <a href="http://maemo.org/packages/view/maemo-geolocation/">provides geolocation</a> through the browser I cannot access that site. That reeks of the bad old times of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/04/letters_0405/">IE-only websites</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> if you need browser sniffing to provide some feature, implement it based on browser capabilities, not the user agent (which <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/28/how-to-emulate-iphone-change-user-agent-in-safari-and-firefox-web-browser/">can anyway be spoofed easily</a>).</p>
