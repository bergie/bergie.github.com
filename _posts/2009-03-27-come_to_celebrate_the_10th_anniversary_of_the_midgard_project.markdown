</p><blockquote>
It's time for celebration - Midgard CMS turns ten in May! The decade of Midgard will be celebrated with a guest gala that is to be held at <a href="http://www.botta.fi/Etusivu.24.0.html?&amp;L=1">restaurant Ostrobotnia</a> in Helsinki, Finland.
</blockquote><p>
Looking forward to seeing as many of you in the party as possible! Please <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/10/registration/">register ASAP</a> as we need to tell the restaurant how many tables are needed.
