We had the traditional Xmas party last night, and despite [Joe's earlier angst][1] almost the whole family attended, including [Joe Suicide][2], [Johnnie-Boy][12] and our favorite rock star, Skoll of [Surma][3] fame. [Jay Surfer][4] was planning to come, but got lost somewhere in the way between [Vallila][5] and [Ullanlinna][6].

We made a turkey filled with onions, minced meat and peppers, and had the fridge stocked with [Punikki][7] ([red guard][8]) beer. After the dinner Kerttu treated us with a tandoori apple pie.

It was very nice to see the "family" come together after last year's [bourgeois][9] period.

[Happy holidays][11] to everybody! Today the plan is to take things easy and go watch [King Kong][10] in the evening...
