Google's <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/knol_google_takes_on_wikipedia.php">Wikipedia competitor</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knol">Knol</a> <a href="http://www.yugatech.com/blog/gooooogle/knol-launched-day-one-spammin-jammin/">launched</a> a while back. It seeks to make writing informative entries more appealing to authors by offering a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html">cut of advertisement revenue</a> from the Knol pages. This <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/10/28/wikipedia-leaves-100m-on-the-table-or-please-jimbo-reconsider/">can be a substantial thing</a> as calculations say if Wikipedia had ads the revenue from them would be <a href="http://www.watchmojo.com/web/blog/?p=626">42 million USD per year</a>.

Having read Neal Stephenson's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash</a> where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash#Important_characters">lead character Hiro</a>, a <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/category/haidonggumdo/">fellow swordfighter</a> and free hacker is making his living by collecting intel to upload onto the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash#Influence_on_the_World_Wide_Web">CIC library</a>, the concept had some appeal. To test it, I created some pages:
</p><blockquote>
<strong><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/henri-bergius/workstreaming/205l6w1dyeyf0/2">Workstreaming</a></strong>
<br />Workstreaming means collecting activities of geographically dispersed team members into a consistent news feed, enabling managers to track process and colleagues to stay up-to-date with the day-by-day happenings.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/henri-bergius/developing-p2p-business-applications/205l6w1dyeyf0/3">Developing P2P business applications</a></strong>
<br />Moving business applications to the web has solved many issues like easier deployment and backups, but at same time introduced a single point of failure in the infrastructure. A group of open source frameworks seeks to solve the issue by helping developers to migrate their applications into resilient and scalable peer-to-peer networks.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://knol.google.com/k/henri-bergius/haedong-kumdo/205l6w1dyeyf0/4">Haedong Kumdo</a></strong>
<br />Haedong Kumdo is a modern martial art based on ancient Korean sword techniques.

This should not detract from my open content activities, as the <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/knol">Knol</a> pages are also <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons-licensed</a>.
