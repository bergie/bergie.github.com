For years <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a> application development has been constrained by the fact that most of the programming work has had to be made through a browser window. Now there is a solution through <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a>.
</p><p>
Earlier usage of better editors has been possible through two slightly hacky solutions:
</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.akbkhome.com/wiki.php/phpmole_IDE/index.html">PHPmole</a>  is a nice <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> for PHP. However, it is written using the PHP-GTK toolkit, making it difficult to install</li><li>The other solution was synchronizing code snippets to filesystem using the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/filesync-addon.html">Aegir FileSync AddOn</a>. However, this didn't work for creating new snippets in the file space</li></ul><p>
But yesterday I wrote a new <a href="">Midgard WebDAV Server</a> class, initially with only snippet editing support. With this system the Midgard snippet library space can be exposed as a network filesystem, or a Web Folder in Windows. This means that the code snippets can be managed completely with all the regular editors and IDEs.
</p><p>
Here's how browsing the <em>/net/nemein</em> <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/">MidCOM</a> component space looks like on my OS X box:
</p><p align="center"><img src="/files/macos-browse-snippets.jpg" border="0" width="450" alt="macos-browse-snippets.jpg" /></p><p>
The WebDAV Server class can be found from <em>src/php-libs/webdav</em> directory of the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/cvs.html">Midgard CVS</a> repository. It requires PHP 4.3+ and the PEAR <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_WebDAV_Server">HTTP_WebDAV_Server</a> package. To use it, create an active and authenticated page with empty style and the following content:
</p><pre>&lt;?php
mgd_include_snippet("/MidgardDav/Server");
?&gt;
</pre><p>
Since this seems to work quite well (although tested only on Mac), we wanted to see  how we could improve our development work using WebDAV. The first solution that came to mind was using the ultra-cool collaborative editor <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>. With it we can easily see what the others in the <a href="http://www.nemein.com/">Nemein</a> team are doing, and get comments and review done. It really makes pair programming much more efficient.
</p><p>
As I write this I'm sitting in a <a href="http://www.lasipalatsi.fi/vuokralaiset/cafelasipalatsi_en.html">WiFi-capable cafe</a>, hacking on some components together with <a href="http://www.kaukolaweb.com/">Kaukola</a>. Here's how it looks (we were adding a new feature to the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/reference/components/de.linkm.taviewer.html">de.linkm.taviewer</a> component):

The lines with blue background have been last edited by me, and the ones with pink background by Kaukola.
