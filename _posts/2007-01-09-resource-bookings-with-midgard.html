<p>Resource booking component <span style="font-weight: bold;">net.nemein.reservations</span> has been finally converted to <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/view/midcom_2_6_released.html">MidCOM 2.6</a> technology. The component allows users to browse available resources, their reservation calendar and make new bookings.</p>

<p>Default usage scenario for the component was meeting room bookings, but the component has been designed so that adding other types of resources like cars or cabins is just a matter of editing a <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/midcom-helper-datamanager2/">datamanager2 schema</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't released the package yet as I want to first wait for test results from a couple of customers. Tomorrow we will pilot the component for airplane reservations at <a href="http://www.mik.fi/">the aviation club</a>.</p>
