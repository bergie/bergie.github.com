[Midgard 1.7][1], the first release sporting _Midgard2_ features like MgdSchema and Query Builder was [released today][2]. To celebrate this, I made a new design for the website, following the "_Prepare for the New Day_" slogan:

![Midgard site circa 2005-07-25](https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/midgard-17-small.jpg)

The [photo][10] in the bottom right corner is from our [climb to Drakensberg][8] with the [Ungana-Afrika][9] people.

While posting the layout to the site, I was reminded about the [xplanet][3] maps the [GNOME][4] and [Debian][5] communities have. After thinking about this for a moment, I decided it would be easy to generate the same information from the [Midgard Who's Who][6].

Here's a small example, with also [bigger ones][7] available:

If you're interested in doing something similar, I've posted a [quick tutorial][11].
