I recently logged in to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diners_Club">Diners Club</a> extranet to check the credit card balance after our <a href="http://bergie.jaiku.com/presence/2685576">trip to Provence</a>, and noticed a new feature there. They had picked some restaurant bills from my credit card statement and asked for me to rate them in a very typical Web 2.0 fashion:

</span>It will be interesting to see what they will start doing with the ratings. <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2005/12/netflix_email_m.html">Netflix-style recommendations</a> of restaurants people with similar tastes like would actually be quite useful.

A question however is whether just silently providing this rating feature on their site is enough for getting people to rate restaurants. Maybe they could <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/netflix_nails_it.php">query for ratings in their newsletter</a> a bit like Netflix also does.

In any case, making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29">mashup</a> of the ratings from Diners Club and <a href="http://www.eat.fi/">location and opening times information from eat.fi</a> would make a perfect "where to go for lunch?" solution.
