[The (Â¬M)VC post](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2010/10/vc_without_m.md) gives some ideas how to improve the Midgard MVC - Content Repository interface.

It is to be noted that Midgard MVC nowadays isn't dependent on Midgard in any way. This was done mostly to enable developers to mix-and-match Midgard2 and Midgard3 data access, but also allows using other storage services like CouchDB.
