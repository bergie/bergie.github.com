<a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a> has a nice <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/01/location-awareness-comes-to-the-linux-platform.ars">introductory article about GeoClue</a>:
</p><blockquote>
A multitude of factors are contributing to a mobile computing renaissance. Some of these factors include the growing availability of ubiquitous mobile Internet connectivity and the rising popularity of netbooks and other Internet-enabled small form-factor devices. These changes are inspiring a renewed interest in location-aware software and web services.
<br /><br />A framework called <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue">GeoClue</a> aims to enable integration of location-aware technologies in Linux desktop applications. It is an abstraction layer that makes geolocation functionality accessible through a standardized desktop-neutral API that is easy for applications to consume. It will provide a C library and also expose its functionality through D-Bus, an interprocess communication system that is widely used on Linux.

In the KDE/Qt end, <a href="http://edu.kde.org/marble/">Marble</a> would provide similar visualization features.
