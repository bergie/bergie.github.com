[Hallo](http://hallojs.org/) is a simple web-based rich text editor. I've [written about it before](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/hallo-editor/). Even though [Create](http://createjs.org/) does support multiple editors, Hallo is the one we ship by default as it combines a relatively small size and a permissive license.

For a while now I've wanted a nice logo for this editor project, and now we have several proposals from people in the community. Please [write your comments](#disqus_thread) below.

**Updated Oct 24th**: We have a top three, please focus your comments to these.

## Top three

Based on the comments we've received, it seems these three are the most popular:
