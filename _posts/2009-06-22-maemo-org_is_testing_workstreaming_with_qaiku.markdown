<a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/03/03/workstreaming-the-new-face-time/">Workstreaming</a> means collecting activities of geographically dispersed team members into a consistent news feed, enabling managers to track process and colleagues to stay up-to-date with the day-by-day happenings. As <a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo.org</a> is a distributed <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo.org_Sprints">project worked on</a> by a group of both volunteers and paid employees, some sort of activity monitoring is quite necessary.
</p><p>
For a while this has been done <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo.org_Sprints#Daily_reporting">in wiki pages</a>, but since that is not very flexible or connected, better ways have been discussed. The current approach being tested is workstreaming via <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/channels/show/maemork/">a Qaiku channel</a>:
</p><p>

</p><p>
<a href="http://www.qaiku.com/">Qaiku</a> is a <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/microblogging-why_qaiku_might_do_what_twitter_and_brightkite_didn-t/">conversation-oriented microblogging service</a> that suits workstreaming quite well:
</p><ul>
<li>It has both <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/">a web view</a> and <a href="http://m.qaiku.com/">a mobile view</a>, meaning you can workstream on-the-go</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qaiku.com/channels/">Channels</a> support means activity log entries don't need to "spam" normal microblogging contacts with workstreams</li>
<li>Private channels means you can track workstreams of confidential projects too</li>
<li><a href="http://www.qaiku.com/api/usage/">API</a> and RSS feeds enable us to integrate the workstreaming feed to the wiki pages or where ever we want to</li>
<li>Separation of comments and actual activity log entries make it easy to discuss things related to the activities</li>
</ul><p>
In near future there will also be support for <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/channels/show/Qaiku-api/view/1de5bfa5c5c83a65bfa11dea402d97edb6074ee74ee/">additional machine-readable "Qaiku Data"</a> (like hour amounts, bug numbers, whatever). This is inspired by the <a href="http://twitterdata.org/">Twitter Data initiative</a>, but keeps the data separate from actual message contents to keep Qaiku human-readable. Once that is done, we could possibly build some more workstreaming-oriented UI for this on maemo.org.
</p><p>
So, if you're doing anything on maemo.org, <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/settings/registration/">sign up on Qaiku</a> and <a href="http://www.qaiku.com/channels/show/maemork/">start posting your updates</a>!
