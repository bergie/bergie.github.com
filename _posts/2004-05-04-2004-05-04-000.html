<p><a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~thunder/bb/">Ximian Build Buddy</a> is a tool for building binary packages for different Linux distributions.</p>

<blockquote>
After reading all documentation available, I decided that Build Buddy is the right tool for publishing our <span style="font-style: italic;">Open Source</span> software which has been created in the last years. A perfect test object is the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard Application Server</a> for which several people have contributed specialized packages for their systems, but no official binary releases exist where the RPM build does the same as the Debian installation, etc.</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the actual tutorial, I look forward to seeing the packages he will produce.<br />
