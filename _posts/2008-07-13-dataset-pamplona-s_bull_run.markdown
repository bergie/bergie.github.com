<a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/">Off the Map</a> has posted <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2008/07/11/dataset-of-the-day-running-of-the-bulls-at-san-fermines-build-your-own-tourist-map/">an interesting dataset of the Pamplona San Fermin bull run</a>:
</p><blockquote>
In honor of the festival that kicked off this week, I thought that this was a great opportunity to show how <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/">Finder!</a> can be a great trip planning tool. With the ability to download geographic datasets of your choice as well as create your own, you can use Finder! to make a custom and interactive map that displays everything you want to do and see on your trip.

I've <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encierro">run with the bulls</a> three times: twice <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bergie/sets/72157604038723975/">in 2001</a>, and once during <a href="http://www.deathmonkey.org/route/pamplona.html">the Death Monkey excursion</a> when I got hit by the bull in the arena, and so I found <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/searches?query=bulls">the dataset</a> quite interesting.
