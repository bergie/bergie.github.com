I've today upgraded the [Midgard][1] development environment on [my MacBook][2] to a more reasonable software setup:

* Midgard 1.8
* PHP 5.1
* MySQL 5
* Apache 2.2

So far things look quite good. I found and fixed some PHP5-related notices in MidCOM, but apart from those it runs really nicely.

This means I get to work on [MultiLang][3] and things like [Microformat parsing][4]. Midgard 1.8 may not be [the jazzy thing][5], but at least it means my devel environment is trendy and not pass√©. :-)
