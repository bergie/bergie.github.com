<p>We <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/tampere_is_a_candidate_for_guadec_and_akademy_2009/">tried to get the combined GUADEC and aKademy conferences</a> to Tampere in 2009, but <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/sets/72157621730088174/">a warmer place</a> unfortunately won. However, <a href="http://www.coss.fi/">we</a> will be hosting <a href="http://akademy.kde.org/">this year's aKademy</a> so at least KDE and Qt fans will get to enjoy this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere">beautiful northern industrial city</a>.</p>
<p>The main conference will be held at the Tampere University over the weekend, and then the remaining hackweek will be in the nice <a href="http://demola.fi/">Demola</a> facility in the Finlayson district. Expect great connectivity and close proximity to all Tampere nightlife.</p>
<p>I'm involved with two aKademy activities:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://akademy.kde.org/node/397"><strong>GeoClue presentation</strong></a> on the <a href="http://geoclue.freedesktop.org/">location service</a> that can be used on any Linux desktop and is <a href="http://meego.com/developers/meego-architecture">used in MeeGo</a>. I'll also talk about what desktops can do when location is available</li>
<li><a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/events/akademy_and_midgard_gathering/"><strong>Midgard Gathering</strong></a> during Mon-Wed of the hackweek. Midgard provides <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application/">a content repository</a> for applications that should be available also for <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/GObjectConsume">Qt apps through GObject Introspection</a>. With some <a href="http://blogs.nemein.com/people/piotras/view/1274453113.html">proven performance benefits</a> and replication support, Midgard should be interesting for any desktop or mobile app that deals with structured data</li>
</ul><p>In addition there will be a <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=56616">Maemo / MeeGo meetup</a> in the Plevna brewery on Friday evening. See you there!</p>
