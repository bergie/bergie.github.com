Right now, the sovereign dept crisis is dominating headlines. Made more acute through irresponsible lending and speculation by banks and the resulting bailouts, it is clearly the big problem of the time.

To gain some perspective into this, I've been reading Debt, a book looking at the credit and economies through the lens of anthropology and history. I'd highly recommend the book to anyone seeking to understand how the current problems have evolved, and what ways might be employed to get us out of them.

Debt crises are not new. Ever since the early Sumerian civilizations, there has been a cycle of debiliting accumulation of debt for the general population, and the centralization of wealth to few select creditors, followed by state intervening to cancel the debts in one way or another.

There have been reasons for states to solve the problem, mainly for security purposes. In the early civilizations, there was a constant threat of workers defecting to outside of the society and joining the nomadic peoples in the hinterland, effectively building up an army that could any time swoop in to pillage and burn. In more advanced socities the reason was simply that _free men fight better_, an important argument for nations in conflict.

The Debt book explains:

> In Greece as in Rome, attempts to solve debt crisis through military expansion were always, ultimately, just ways of fending off the problem - and they only worked for a limited period of time. When expansion stopped , everything returned to as it had been before. Actually, it's not clear that all forms of debt bondage were ever eliminated even in citites like Athens and Rome. In cities that were not successful military powers, without any source of income to set up welfare policies, debt crises continued to flare up every century or so - and they often became far more acute than they ever had in the Middle East, because there was no mechanism, short of outright revolution, to declare a Mesopotamian-style clean slate. Large populations, even in the Greek world, did, in fact, sink to the rank of serfs and clients.

That fits the current crisis into a historical context. Isn't it a _centyury or so_ since the 1930s depression? Maybe couple of generations is the cadence in which debt and interest accumulate to the levels of becoming untenable?

There are some new aspects to the current debt crisis. However, credit swaps, which brought so many banks into the state of requiring state intervention, is not one of these. There exists clay tablet evidence of debts being bought and sold already back in the Sumerian times, without the need for computerized systems or Wall Street invention.

What is new is the large portion of states being in debt to external powers. Many present-day Greeks might find these words of Plutarch familiar, even if from around 100CE:

> And as King Darius sent to the city of Athens his lieutenants Datis and Artaphernes with chains and cords, to bind the prisoners they should take; so these usurers, bringing into Greece boxes full of schedules, bills, and obligatory contracts, as so many irons and fetters for the shackling of poor criminals...
