Welcome to the latest iteration of my blog! I recently realized that I've been blogging [since 1997](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/news-page-launch/), but actual visual or technical updates have been a lot more seldom.

This new blog aims to focus on simplicity and content, much in the spirit of [Zeldman's 2012 web design manifesto](http://www.zeldman.com/2012/05/18/web-design-manifesto-2012/). You can find a lot more about how this iteration was built [in the colophon](http://bergie.iki.fi/colophon/).

For reference, here is how the [old site layout](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/welcome_to_my_new_blog/) from 2007 looked like:

![2006 edition](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/bergieikifi-20120531-small.png)

And here is the current iteration:

![2012 edition](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/bergieikifi-20120531new-small.png)

I hope you enjoy the 2012 edition. I've also imported lots of old posts that have not been available on this site for years, including [this one](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard-launch/) from 1998 telling how we were starting to work on [Midgard](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/category/midgard/). You may also enjoy the [old motorcycle travel journals](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/category/motorcycles/).
