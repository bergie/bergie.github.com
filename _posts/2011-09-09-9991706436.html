<a href="http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/09/08/ldapjs-a-reprise-of-ldap/">Implement LDAP servers in JavaScript</a><br/><p>I&#8217;m quite excited about this. LDAP has always been an interesting protocol, but with rather complicated implementations.</p>

<p>Node.js in general seems to have potential in reviving various purpose-designed protocols, as they will be just as easy to handle as HTTP.</p>

<p>If I find the time, I&#8217;ll look into connecting this with <a href="https://github.com/NoCR/NoCR">NoCR</a>, as that provides a standard tree handling API with different storage back-end</p>
