While <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/tampere_is_a_candidate_for_guadec_and_akademy_2009/">Tampere</a> <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1215794861/">was lost</a>, we won't return from <a href="http://guadec.expectnation.com/public/content/main">GUADEC</a> without any medals: I <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/keybuk/2664226776/">won</a> the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GUADEC/2008/Events/IceCreamDeathmatch">ice cream deathmatch</a> held during the Collabora boat party on Bosphorus.

<a href="http://www.vuntz.net/journal/2008/07/11/481-guadec-notes-3">From Vincent Untz</a>:
</p><blockquote>
We of course had the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GUADEC/2008/Events/IceCreamDeathmatch">Ice Cream Deathmatch</a>. So, it seems people thought it was all about speed, while really it's all about enjoying :-) On the other hand, Henri Bergius (if I remember well) is just not a human since he ate everything so quickly. But, well, his <a href="http://guadec.expectnation.com/guadec08/public/schedule/speaker/82">bio</a> mentions "Henri Bergius is a former Viking based in the Nordic country of Finland"...

Vincent, the whole point is that if you enter a competition, enter it to win. Regardless of whether that involves eating ice cream, <a href="http://www.routamc.org/sprintti-2004/">racing crappy cars to the Arctic Ocean</a>, or <a href="http://www.deathmonkey.org/">crossing Europe on 50cc "Monkey" mini-mopeds</a>. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/quotes">If you're not the first, you're the last</a> [1].
