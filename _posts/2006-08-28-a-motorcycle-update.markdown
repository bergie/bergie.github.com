While I was riding [with the Monkeys][1], my [Triumph Legend TT][2] left a friend on the road with a broken engine. As the number of motorcycles in Finland has [grown drastically][3] in last few years, but the number of repair shops hasn't, the bike has since been waiting for diagnosis.

Today the garage finally was able to open the engine and discover the issue. After 80,000 kilometers, the bearings of the central cylinder had failed, fouling the [crankshaft][4]. Now we'll have to wait for new parts before the engine can be fixed and rebuilt.

In any case, I'm relieved to hear of progress in the case. Hopefully we can again head for new [adventures][5] soon...

What has surprised me, though, is how little spending the summer bikeless has stressed me. Probably the 5,000 kilometers on a moped had something to do with it, as did [the company][7] going slightly greener by subsidizing [public transport][6]...

__Updated 2006-09-03:__ Got some bad news about the bike. If the crankshaft has to be replaced, it may cost thousands of Euros to get running. In that case buying an used Triumph from Germany would be already cheaper.
