I have <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/british-rfid-passports-cracked/">criticized the remote-readable EU passports</a> before, but today I got to try their benefits: the <a href="http://www.raja.fi/rvl/home.nsf/pages/BB81D9DD58E23D0EC225747F004CCA09?Opendocument">automated border controls at Helsinki-Vantaa airport</a>. 
</p><p>
I was returning back <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/bergie">from Switzerland</a>, and although they've recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_treaty#Switzerland">joined the Schengen treaty</a>, air passengers are still checked for passports until March. This means that the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/3176914834/">Finnair flight</a> still ended up in the non-Schengen terminal of <a href="http://www.helsinki-vantaa.fi/home?">Helsinki-Vantaa</a>, forcing me to go through the border checks.
</p><p>
I'd seen the machines there before, and as I now wasn't in a hurry, I decided to try them. The experience is quite cool, but somehow it also feels a bit scary to validate your entry to your home country to a machine.

To <a href="http://www.raja.fi/rvl/home.nsf/pages/BB81D9DD58E23D0EC225747F004CCA09?Opendocument">enter the country</a> you insert the passport into a reader, which then opens the first gate. Inside that gate is another machine in front of which you need to stand. It takes a picture, and apparently compares that to the one stored on the chip in the passport. If the pictures match, a second gate opens and you're in the country.
</p><p>
I considered keeping <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/tags/hat/">my hat</a> on to see what happens if the identification fails, but then decided not to bother.
</p><p>
In any case, as with <a href="http://www.finnair.com/finnaircom/wps/portal/finnair/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKL9473DAbJgFguPvqRqCLOnqgiLvHO3nARX4_83FT9oNS8eE-_EH1v_QD9gtzQ0IhyR0UABg4znw!!/delta/base64xml/L3dJdyEvd0ZNQUFzQUMvNElVRS82X0tfM1VG">electronic check-in machines</a>, people generally are too afraid of technology to use the automated border check, meaning that this is a great way to skip queues.
</p><p>
Of course, none of this would require the passports to be <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/08/e_passports_fingerprinted/">remotely readable</a>, not to mention the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/09/how_to_clone_an.html">other security issues</a> with them.
