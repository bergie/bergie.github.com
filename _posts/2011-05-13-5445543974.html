<p>Just stumbled on this item by <a href="http://gonzalo123.wordpress.com/about/">Gonzalo Ayuso</a>.</p>

<p>What caught my eye was the three words - PHP, websockets, nodejs.</p>

<p>Very interesting article complete with code. This will allow you to take a peek on how these three work together.</p>

<p>A nice read and very informative. If you got time, try the code out and build a real-world, working project out of it.</p>

<p>Happy monitoring!</p>
