To celebrate these developments, my website is now available under the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Attribution-Sharealike license 2.0</a>. This can be identified in the &quot;Some rights reserved&quot; link in bottom of each page, and in machine-readable <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/work-html-popup?lang=en&license_code=by-sa&format=text">RDF metadata</a> included in the pages.</p>
At least the <a href="http://www.yergler.net/projects/mozcc/">mocCC</a> extension for the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> browser identifies my site licensing correctly:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="1" src="https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/bergie-cc-footer.jpg" /></div>
<p>Apparently, not everybody is completely happy about the new licenses. <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/louie/">Luis Villa</a> writes:</p>

Was cool to see that Creative Commons released new licenses, and I updated my stuff, but there is no longer an option to do non-attribution licenses, which makes them fairly non-free, DFSG-wise. That is unfortunate.

DFSG is the <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>, a set of rules on what kind of software licenses can be allowed to the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> distribution.
