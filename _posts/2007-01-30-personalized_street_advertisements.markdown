Maybe I'm a [neo-luddite][6], but [this sounds a bit scary][1]:

> The boards, which usually carry typical advertising, are programmed to identify approaching Mini drivers through a coded signal from a radio chip embedded in their key fob. The messages are personal, based on questionnaires that owners filled out.

This sounds like we are approaching the [Minority Report world][3]:

> Everywhere that John Anderton (Tom Cruise) went, his eyes were being scanned for identification. I'm not talking just about restricted areas - he was scanned entering the Metro, driving home from work, and even walking into The Gap. The advertisements called him by name: _"John Anderton, we have the ideal vacation for you!"_ and _"John Anderton, wouldn't you like a pint of Guinness?"_ But not even a pint of Guinness would have soothed my nerves after hearing my name called out all day long. If you thought spam was annoying, you ain't seen nothing yet.

__In related news__, [gestures in the iPhone][4] will of course bring [Minority Report -style computing][5] for us too. I wonder when Nokia's [Maemo][7] devices get that too.
