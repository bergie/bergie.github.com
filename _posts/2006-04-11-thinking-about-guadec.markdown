This year's [GUADEC][1] will be held in [Catalonia][2] on Jun 24th - 30th. We've left [a proposal][4] with  [Tuomas][3], so I hope I will be able to attend.

>  __Summary:__ Web applications, collaboration, information accessible from different devices. How could we integrate web based tools better with our desktop?

I was talking about [Open Source Content Management][5] in the [Dublin][7] [GUADEC][6] and was already trying to get people interested in these things. If Open Source is to succeed, we need integration between collaborative server systems and desktop applications.

__Updated 2006-04-19:__ [Our talk][4] has been scheduled for Tuesday June 27th in the [preliminary schedule][8], but it also says:

> BEING LISTED HERE DOESN'T IMPLY THAT A SESSION IS ACCEPTED, nor that it will be held the day it has been placed.

__Updated 2006-05-05:__ Our talk has been approved!
