I sent some notes to the [Placeopedia][1] team. Placeopedia is a service connecting [Wikipedia][2] pages with their locations on the map.

> I would be a good idea to switch Placeopedia to use Google Maps hybrid mode, as there are no maps for places outside US and UK.

> Try this for example <http://www.placeopedia.com/?9356>

> Doesn't make much sense before you click "Hybrid".

> It is easy to make the Google Map [Hybrid Mode][3] by default. Simply call `map.setMapType(G_HYBRID_TYPE);`

> Anyway, thanks for making this great service! Position data really adds to the Wikipedia experience.

> Since you provide nice "things near this coordinate" [RSS feed][7] I've been [thinking about][4] building a tool based on [Plazes][8] and that.

> BTW, are there any plans to synchronize the Placeopedia data with [Wikipedia itself][5]?

I noticed the map mode issue when trying to place [Petja's question][6].
