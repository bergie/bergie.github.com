<a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/11/01/nokia-the-n810-tablet-the-long-view/">GigaOM has a very interesting article</a> on the <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/10/17/the-nokia-n810-internet-tablet/">new N810 internet tablet</a>, and how it will be relevant for the developing world:

<blockquote>Infonetics estimates that 47 percent of all mobile subscribers come from the Asia Pacific region, 36 percent from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and only 9 percent from North America. Nokia alone will ship 400 million handsets this year, and most of those devices can surf the web. Geography, power consumption, and lack of wired infrastructure mean that much of the planet will see its first web page on a portable handset. Not only will Internet handsets be everywhere, theyâ€™ll be open.</blockquote>Via <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/11/02/nokia-takes-the-long-view-of-the-walkaround-web-2/">Internet Tablet Talk</a>.
