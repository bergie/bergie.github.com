Let me share a little piece of Internet happiness: When I got my iPhone, I wondered how could its web browser be so dramatically faster than the <a href="http://www.vasanth.in/2008/01/30/N810MicroBBrowser.aspx">one on my N810</a>. Could it be just that iPhone has faster processor, and uses <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> instead of Mozilla? But at the same time, the state-of-the-art <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox 3</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bergie/tags/macbookair/">my MacBook Air</a> was also feeling sluggish.
</p><p>
After giving this a little bit of thought, I decided, Flash must be the guilty party. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a>, as we know, is Adobe's proprietary framework for building multimedia-rich applications, and iPhone simply <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/12/its-official-no-flash-support-on-the-iphone-yet/">doesn't support it</a>. Sometimes Flash is actually used for building interesting applications, but most usage online seems to be just fancy animated banners. So, I thought, there must be a smart way to get rid of Flash. And there is: With Firefox you can use the <a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">FlashBlock extension</a> to excise all Flash content off the pages:

</p><p>
With other browsers you could off course uninstall the Flash plug-in, but the problem is that sometimes there is Flash content you actually want to see. And in these cases FlashBlock works perfectly: each Flash area on a site is replaced with a box that you can activate at will. So before <a href="http://ostatic.com/172399-blog/chrome-javascript-and-flash-two-mostly-opposing-views">Flash is made obsolete</a> by the recent <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/140/html5-media-support/">advancements in HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.pathf.com/blogs/2008/08/faster-javascript-for-firefox-31-thru-jit/">Javascript</a>, this option is the best of both worlds.
