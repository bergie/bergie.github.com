Bergie's military service ended on Dec 29th 2000.

I'm now back from my six months long military service period.

During my service time, I served as a corporal in TOW anti-tank missile squadron's reconnaissance patrol. My training included missile and bazooka usage, explosives, personal firearms and reconnaissance courses.

I have some good photos taken during combat exercises there, and I'm planning to add those to my gallery once I get time to scan them.
In the meanwhile, here's a link to image showing a TOW missile launch.
