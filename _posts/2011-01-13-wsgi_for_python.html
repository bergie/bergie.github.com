<p>Python <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">specification for a Web Server Gateway Interface</a> has been <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2011-January/004979.html">accepted</a>, with quite ambitious goals:</p>
<blockquote>If middleware can be both simple and robust, and WSGI is widely available in servers and frameworks, it allows for the possibility of an entirely new kind of Python web application framework: one consisting of loosely-coupled WSGI middleware components. Indeed, existing framework authors may even choose to refactor their frameworks' existing services to be provided in this way, becoming more like libraries used with WSGI, and less like monolithic frameworks. This would then allow application developers to choose "best-of-breed" components for specific functionality, rather than having to commit to all the pros and cons of a single framework.</blockquote>
<p>Something like this would be healthy also for the highly fragmented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#PHP">PHP web frameworks</a> world. In library space PHP may be finally <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/php-finally_getting_an_ecosystem/">getting a real code-sharing ecosystem</a>, but actual interoperability of web components is much further away.</p>
