I had my [Midgard tutorial][1] in [Fórum GNOME][2] today, and it turned out to be a near disaster. English is not very widely spoken in [Brazil][3], and my audience couldn't really follow my talk. 

Luckily [GIMP][4] developer _João Bueno_ came to the rescue and acted as an excellent [Portuguese][5] translator. This saved the session and enabled me to have meaningful interaction with the attendees. It will be interesting to see how Midgard turns out in here. Anyway, thanks again, João!
