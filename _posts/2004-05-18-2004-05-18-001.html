Before everyone had cell phones we would always schedule meetings to some easy-to-access place, like the railway station. But now it is so easy to arrange meetings on the fly, and so nobody plans them ahead. However, without mobile phone this is impossible.<br /><br />What makes the situation increasingly funny is that the customer service lines of this <a href="http://www.sonera.fi/">telco</a> are blocked in phone booths, which are operated by another <a href="http://www.elisa.fi/">telco</a>. Good luck trying to fix the problem, I guess...<br /><br />This makes me think how handy would a combine <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,43085,00.html">SMS</a>/instant messaging system be. If I'm online, the messages would go to my computer, and when offline to my cell phone. With scenario like that this would've been a complete non-issue.<br /><br />Multimedia messages (<a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,400,00.html">MMS</a>) already have a system like this where people who don't have a MMS-capable cell phone can receive their messages through a web interface.<br />
