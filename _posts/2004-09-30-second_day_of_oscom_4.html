After bit of thinking I decided that a session on <a href="http://oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/midcom.html">MidCOM - Midgard's Component Framework for PHP</a> would be a good match for the technical crowd here.Because of this most of my has been spent on setting up latest <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/">MidCOM</a> on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</a>, tweaking my <a href="http://www.routamc.org/journal/Glimpse%20of%20Africa/">South African</a><a href="http://www.ungana-afrika.org/news/media_files/PR_120204.htm">Midgard training</a> slides in <a href="http://www.slideml.org/">SlideML</a> to fit this conference, and marveling how slow the iBook is for running a full-blown CMS.<br />
My session will be tomorrow at 9:15 in room E1.2 in the <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/">ETH</a> main building.
</p><p>
In addition I gave a 20 minute <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/midcom-serveattachmentguid-61e21f44e9eca1350e2487948bda4ea7/Bergie_OSCOM_Interview_Preview.jpg">interview</a> for the Open Source community related movie <a href="http://www.wyona.com/people/michael-wechner/">Michael Wechner</a> is working on. Quote from there:
</p><blockquote>
  [Finnish culture promotes collaboration and Open Source because] Finland is a cold country. If we didn't work together we would all freeze to death and get eaten by polar bears.
</blockquote><p>
Some stuff from today's discussions:
</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR-170</a> is an API for Java that aims to standardize how CMSs store their content into a repository. There is also a <a href="http://thinkforge.org/projects/php170/">PHP port</a> under construction</li><li>I installed <a href="http://www.webalizer.org/">Webalizer</a> to OSCOM's web server today, and the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/webalizer/index.html">access statistics</a> are abysmal. How could we get CMS projects to link to OSCOM?</li><li><a href="http://blog.bitflux.ch/">Chregu</a> has promised to upgrade <a href="http://www.oscom.org/planet-oscom/">Planet OSCOM</a> from <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/projects/midcom/components/net.nemein.rss.html">net.nemein.rss</a> to the same software that drives <a href="http://www.planet-php.net/">Planet PHP</a></li><li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> has an active community of thousands of people who are not programmers but instead market OOo actively. For them being involved is the reward. <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">Spread Firefox</a> also is a good example of that</li><li>There is now first draft of <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/community/development/mrfc/0008.html">mRFC 0008</a>, the time-based releases proposal for Midgard</li></ul><p>
The planned <em>Town Hall on Open Source and Ethical Capitalism</em> with Kit Blake and Michael Wechner got <a href="http://www.derickrethans.nl/month-2004-09.php?item=200409241426#200409241426">rasmussed</a> by the very interesting panel on <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/openinnovation">open innovation</a>.
</p><p>
In the evening there will be the conference dinner in Les Halles. We also planned a  meeting about <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/skins">CSS namespacing</a> with Thorsten, but this didn't happen because of all other discussion going on.

Amusing note: Everybody starts their first conversation with me by saying "I've read about your <a href="http://www.routamc.org/">motorcycle adventures</a> in your blog". :-)
