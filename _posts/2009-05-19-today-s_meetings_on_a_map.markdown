I've got no information on the validity of the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5260260/nokias-leaked-future-tablet-screenshot-large-smartphone">claimed Harmattan screenshots</a> that are floating around, but anyway wanted to comment on a part of it:

Having your today's meetings on a map would be really cool.

This is something I've wanted to do with <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/">OpenPSA</a> ever since the days I spent motorcycling around office districts of Helsinki giving <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a> demos. I'd often have only 15 minutes to move from one presentation to another, and at that pace figuring out the locations was a pain in the ass.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">Geocoding</a> meeting and TODO item locations would be a problem, but if that was solved this would be a killer feature. Maybe something we could do with <a href="http://folks.o-hand.com/jku/geoclue-docs/Geocode.html">GeoClue</a> and <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/libchamplain/">libchamplain</a>?
