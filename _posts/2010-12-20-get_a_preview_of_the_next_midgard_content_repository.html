<p><a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/midgardcr_10-12-hrungnir-released/"><img src="https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/1e00c7c2d85daa80c7c11e0b9fe1954500ef74cf74c_midgardcr.png" border="0" alt="MidgardCR" title="MidgardCR - a free content repository" style="float:right;" />Midgard 10.12 was released</a> last week as a developer preview of what is coming in the world of content repositories:</p>
<blockquote>MidgardCR 10.12 "Hrungnir" is a technology preview of the third generation of the Midgard Content Repository. It is released to allow developers to gain familiarity with the upcoming Midgard storage APIs and RDF storage. <br /><br /> MidgardCR is available as a GObject-oriented C library with language bindings for multiple languages including Python, JavaScript, Scheme and Java through GObject Introspection. <br /><br />Content managed in MidgardCR can be stored to multiple relational databases supported by the GNOME Database Abstraction Library. Databases tested with MidgardCR include SQLite, MySQL and Postgres.</blockquote>
<p>While this might not be something for production use, especially on the web as the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/indeyets/gobject-for-php">GObject Introspection bindings for PHP5</a> aren't done yet, it ought anyway to be interesting to developers. Suddenly you have <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application/">a full content repository</a> that can not only <a href="https://github.com/midgardproject/midgard-core/blob/master/src/vala/examples/example2.vala">store regular content</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/midgardproject/midgard-core/blob/master/src/vala/examples/rdf_example.vala">also RDF triples</a>. And this with pretty much <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Users">any programming language</a> you would like to use.</p>
<p>The new MidgardCR is also interesting in the sense that it has been written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vala_(programming_language)">Vala</a> instead of straight C, making it more accessible for potential contributors. Grab the project <a href="https://github.com/midgardproject/midgard-core">from GitHub</a> or install <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/midgardproject:/hrungnir/">to your favorite distribution</a>. And stay tuned for more Midgard announcements later this winter.</p>
