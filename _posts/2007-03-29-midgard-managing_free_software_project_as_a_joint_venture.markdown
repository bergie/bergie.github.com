I just held my presentation about how the [Midgard][1] community works in the Norwegian [Open Source in Business][2] conference. Here are the slides:

After some discussions with [Aaron Seigo][3] from the [KDE][4] project, there seem to be a lot of commonality in how the two projects are run, though Midgard obviously in a smaller scale.

Later today I will also run a Midgard workshop here since the [eZ Publish][4] guys cancelled.
