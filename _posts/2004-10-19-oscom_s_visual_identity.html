We were thinking in <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/">OSCOM 4</a> about how to get the different <a href="http://www.oscom.org/matrix/index.html">Open Source CMS projects</a> to feel more connected with the OSCOM process. One part of this was to get some <a href="http://oscom.org/get-involved/mailing-lists/general/2004-October/000257.html">link buttons</a> that would make it easier for the projects to link to OSCOM.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Marc Infield</strong> from <a href="http://www.infielddesign.com/">Infield Design</a> responded quickly to <a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/">Gregor's</a> request. Here are his OSCOM "stamps":

<p>
The usage policy for these is still unresolved. Some ideas would be, though:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The winged stamp would be the official OSCOM logo, usable only by the <a href="http://www.oscom.org/get-involved/bylaws.html">OSCOM association</a></li>
  <li>The other stamps could be used by individuals, projects and companies as a badge showing participation to the OSCOM process</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For companies and individual developers this means attending
OSCOM <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/sprints/">Sprints</a> or <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/">conferences</a> actively and having a weblog or
news feed aggregated on <a href="http://planet.oscom.org/">Planet OSCOM</a></li>
  <li>For Content Management Systems it means that they have to be
available under an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">OSI-approved license</a> and listed on the
OSCOM <a href="http://www.oscom.org/matrix/index.html">CMS Matrix</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>We could have similar logo policy as <a href="http://www.debian.org/logos/">Debian has</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
This way the OSCOM stamp would be a quality criteria for CMS projects, telling that they are committed on working on implementing common standards in their system and developing the field of Open Source CMS in general. It would also enable end-users to distinguish real Open Source projects from proprietary ones, a bit like the <a href="http://opensource.org/trademarks/">OSI keyhole</a> does for licenses.
