The first [Driver workshop][1] for companies integrating open source business applications to the [Digital Business Ecosystem][2] was held this week in Tampere.

[Nemein][3] is one of the companies [participating][4] in the project. The plan is to integrate the [OpenPSA][5] project management system into the framework together with [Jukka Zitting][6] from [Yukatan][7]. Once this integration has been done, companies can use OpenPSA to distribute tasks and report hours with their business partners.

The workshop tutorial was run by Bob and Pablo from [Techideas][8] in Barcelona. Based on it, Jukka blogged [a nice DBE summary][9].

I didn't have much to contribute to the technical discussion, as it dealt with Java and Jini specifics, but at least I coded the [DBE example service][10], and Jukka's laptop was able to query the current date from my powerbook over the [Fada P2P network][11].

In addition to the technical content, [Dr Mary Darking][12] from [London School of Economics][13] talked about the community structure of the [project][14], and the possible governance models. When we were interviewed for the Drivers project, we gave some complaints about the [lack of openness][15] in the project, and it seems that things are [improving][16].

While DBE has lots of challenges ahead of it, including the fact that the funded part of the project is ending quite soon, the [possibilities][17] are also very interesting.

Look for more updates in [Planet DBE][18].
