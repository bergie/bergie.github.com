We held the _[Feeds, Synchronization and the Free Software Desktop][6]_ talk with [Tigert][5] today. Despite the [Fluendo party][1] the night before, there was a quite good crowd in the old [Museu Balaguer library][7].

![Speech in the Biblioteca Museu Victor Balaguer](https://d2vqpl3tx84ay5.cloudfront.net/Tigert_and_Bergie_talk_in_Balaguer.jpg)

The key ideas from the talk were:

* Applications should synchronize with their corresponding social web services
* Synchronization with Web 2.0 would solve both easy information sharing and backups
* Native apps are still more usable than web sites and provide off-line support

As a tangent we discussed also integrating "where" into the desktop:

* Adding location information into the desktop would enable lots of [new services][9]
* Location should be a centralized service in the desktop
* There should be multiple sources of position: GPS, [Plazes][4], manually entered, ...

Same ideas would also work on [770][8].

__In the other news,__ due to the [big badge swap][2] of last night, I'm currently carrying the identity of _[Chema Casanova][3]_.
