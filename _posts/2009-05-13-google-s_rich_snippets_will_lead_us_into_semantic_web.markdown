This February I wrote <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/search_engines_have_an_important_role_in_semantic_web/">how search engines play an important role</a> in emergence of Semantic Web, and now it is <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/05/google-announces-support-for-m.html">becoming a reality</a>:
</p><blockquote>
Google introduced a feature called Rich Snippets which provides users with a convenient summary of a search result at a glance. They have been experimenting with microformats and RDFa, and are officially introducing the feature and allowing more sites to participate. While the Google announcement makes it clear that this technology is being phased in over time making no guarantee that your site's RDFa or microformats will be parsed, Google has given us a glimpse of the future of indexing.

While I haven't seen any enhanced results yet in my searches, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-search-now-supports-microformats-and-adds-rich-snippets-to-search-results-19055">Search Engine Land had a screenshot</a> of reviews being shown with a restaurant:

So far Google is using only <a href="http://google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146645">review</a> and <a href="http://google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146646">person</a> data, but they're also <a href="http://google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146898">advising</a> how to mark up <a href="http://google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146861">company</a> and <a href="http://google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146750">product</a> information. <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/semantic_web_is_here-yahoo-and_microformats/">Yahoo! has been using microformats</a> for a while now, too.
</p><p>
Once these "<a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html">Rich Snippets</a>" get rolled out a bit further the fact that <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a>-powered sites have been <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/microformat-usage-in-midcom/">carrying microformatted content</a> <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/openpsa-calendar-goes-horizontal/">since 2005</a> will become a big advantage. With <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/starting_the_interactive_knowledge_project/">the Interactive Knowledge project</a> we will start looking more seriously at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> too.
