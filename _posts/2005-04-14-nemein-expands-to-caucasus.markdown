[We've][1] just announced [something interesting][2], an expansion to the [Georgian market][3]. This new development follows the [franchising strategy][4] I've outlined earlier.

This should produce some very interesting business opportunities, and let us focus on [internationalization][5] even more strongly than earlier. We already have a translation of the [website][7] and [OpenPSA][9] to [Georgian][8], with [Midgard CMS][10] localizations to follow...

Welcome to the team, [Taya][6]!
