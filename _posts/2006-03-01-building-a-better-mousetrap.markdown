[Chris Glass][5] has posted a HOWTO on a [more humane mousetrap][1]:

>  Balance the tube precariously on the edge of a table or counter with the treat hanging directly over the tall sided receptacle.
The mouse will scurry to the treat (they like tunnels) and fall into the trap.

I learned this technique from the [Kapulainen][2] kids when spending childhood summers in [Turku archipelago][3]. They were using it to catch a forest mouse to keep as a pet. It didn't work with rats, though, as they were strong enough to jump out of the bucket after capture.

I'd completely forgotten the episode until I ran into this story on [Boing Boing][4] tonight.
