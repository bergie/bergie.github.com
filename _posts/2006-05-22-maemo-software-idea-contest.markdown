I'm surprised nobody has mentioned [Open Tuesday's][7] [Nokia 770 Application Development Competition][1] on [Planet Maemo][2] yet.

> The competition's goal is to find new applications targeted to Nokia 770 Open Source Internet tablet. There are three categories in the competition:

> 1. Entertainment Applications
> 2. Business Applications
> 3. Vertical Solutions

> The winners will receive a Nokia 770 device.

Application development competition sounds like actual app would need to be developed, but reading the [rules][1] it seems just an idea is enough.

While I [already have][3] a [770][4], this could still be a good opportunity to hash out my ideas for Nokia 770 as the [real hitchhiker's guide][5].
