<li>
<strong>Design your product or service</strong>. This is the single most important step for business success. You should be clear enough about what you offer to be able to explain it in couple of sentences.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Select the target market</strong>. Then either manually or by buying from some marketing firm acquire a list of companies and their contact persons. Import this to <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/openpsa/sales.html">OpenPSA Contacts</a>.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Create a campaign</strong> from your contacts in OpenPSA and approach them either by phone, email and regular mail. Usually a combination of these works. If your offering is a relevant one expect about 3-8% response rate.
</li>

<li><strong>Start sales projects</strong> in OpenPSA Sales for the companies that show interest and start arranging meetings. Handle all contacts and documents related to the process in <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/openpsa/">OpenPSA</a> and monitor how your sales are doing by checking out the pipeline report.
</li>

<li>
Once you get contracts add the delivery tasks to <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/openpsa/projects.html">OpenPSA Projects</a> together with the pricing information. <strong>Track the projects</strong> by scheduling them to the <a href="http://www.nemein.com/en/solutions/calendar.html">Calendar</a> and then reporting hours, expenses and mileages into OpenPSA. You can also store the project documentation in OpenPSA Documents.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Invoice your work</strong> based on the information in OpenPSA Reports. You can also design your custom invoice templates there. Track the payments either manually or using some financial software package.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Make support or maintenance contracts</strong> with the clients and handle their questions and problems using <a href="http://www.openpsa.org/openpsa/support.html">OpenPSA Support</a>. Keep track of response times and customer satisfaction by setting SLAs and monitoring the Support reports.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Profit!</strong>
