<p><a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard/8.09/">Midgard 8.09</a> is an <em>industrial CMS</em> that is now in <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/long-term_support_for_midgard-ragnaroek_is_here/">Long-Term Supported</a> stage, with the community maintaining it until 2013. As we all know, <a href="http://www.rockstarapps.com/wordpress/?p=40">performance is a feature</a>, and with a CMS framework that has lived through many changes including transitions from PHP4 to 5.2 and from <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/reference/#9f42c2021f0b0efedacd0ae9d6801c5c">Classic Midgard</a> era to the modern APIs, there is a lot to do.</p>
<p>For the next 8.09.10 release we decided to put quite a bit of efforts into performance tuning, with some excellent work done by <a href="http://www.contentcontrol-berlin.de/">Content Control</a> to simplify <a href="http://midgardwiki.contentcontrol-berlin.de/index.php/MidCOM_ACL">ACL handling</a> and cache <a href="http://midgardwiki.contentcontrol-berlin.de/index.php/MidCOM_NAP">navigation information</a>. As you can see, the result is quite impressive:</p>

<p>What is left to be done is some work with the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/midgard-and-multilingual-content/">multilingual content</a> database queries. After that we should be good to go with what is probably the fastest Midgard1 ever.</p>
