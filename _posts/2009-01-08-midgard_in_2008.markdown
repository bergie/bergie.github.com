As it was <a href="http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/2009/01/happy-new-year.html">for the Zend folks</a>, 2008 was quite a busy year also in the <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/">Midgard</a>-land. I think the last time there was so much <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/midgard/analyses/latest">activity and energy</a> in the project must've been sometime in the early days. Here are some highlights from it:
</p><p>
<span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>Midgard 2: finally a reality</strong></span>
</p><p>
The big news of 2008 was that Midgard 2, the <a href="http://www.kaktus.cc/weblog/4658b837d2e9075028380198a39fbc0f/">long-time</a> holy grail of the project finally <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard_2-finally_legacy-free/">became a reality</a>: something you could actually <a href="http://teroheikkinen.iki.fi/blog/some_documentation_about_installing_midgard_2/">install</a> and <a href="http://blogs.nemein.com/people/piotras/view/1208851555.html">run</a>. In addition for all C code having been rewritten from scratch, the Midgard 2 stack also includes <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard_2-more_than_just_php-more_than_just_cms/">language bindings</a> to <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/mgdschema-in-php/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/python_midgard/">Python</a> and Mono, and a completely new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a> framework, the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/some_plans_for_midcom_3/">MidCOM 3</a>. Inter-process communications are facilitated by <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/interprocess_communications_in_midgard-d-bus_comes_to_the_web/">D-Bus</a> and <a href="http://teroheikkinen.iki.fi/blog/how_midgard_2_talks_between_between_machines/">XMPP</a>.
</p><p>
A stable release targeted for <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/maemo_and_midgard_go_well_together/">mobile</a> and <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midcom_3_at_a_glance/">web application</a> developers will be released in March 2009, codenamed <a href="http://trac.midgard-project.org/milestone/9.03%20Vinland">Vinland</a>. This will make Midgard an <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/introduction_to_midgards_database_abstraction_system/">interesting storage framework</a>, regardless of whether you're working on <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo</a> or <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>New communications, new release process</strong></span>
</p><p>
<a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard_releases_and_marketing/">How to communicate</a> Midgard's uniqueness was a <a href="http://nettiapina.fi/blog/2008/07/17/marketing-midgard/">big discussion</a> during the summer, and as a result we settled on a new, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard_(software)">more fitting positioning</a>:
</p><blockquote>
Midgard is an Open Source persistent storage framework. It provides an object-oriented and replicated environment for building data-intensive applications.
</blockquote><p>
The theme was expanded further in <a href="http://fscons.org/">FSCONS</a> when we started describing our vision of enabling users to <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard2_at_fscons-your_data-everywhere/">have their data with them, at any time, and on any device</a>.
</p><p>
In addition to the new communications, we also clarified the release process by joining the larger <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/150">free software release synchronicity movement</a>. From autumn 2008 onwards, there will be <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard_and_synchronized_releases/">a stable Midgard release happening every six months</a>, followed with smaller bug fix or feature enhancement releases.
</p><p>
The first release to follow this new pattern was <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/midgard/8.09/">Midgard 8.09 Ragnaroek</a>, a <a href="http://teroheikkinen.iki.fi/blog/what_are_the_keypoints_of_business_value_generation_with_long_term_support/">long-term supported</a> release that will be the last generation to include the old <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/reference/#9f42c2021f0b0efedacd0ae9d6801c5c">Midgard 1.x codebase</a>.
</p><p>
To make <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/installation/">Midgard installation</a> easier, we also started using the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</a>, which enables us to provide <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/documentation/installation-distros/">binary packages to many popular Linux platforms</a>.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>Leaner and meaner Midgard</strong></span>
</p><p>
A lot of focus was also put into making Midgard <a href="http://teroheikkinen.iki.fi/blog/how_much_more_torque_midcom_3_really_gives/">run faster</a> and <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/some_thoughts_on_green_programming-php-midgard_and_simplicity/">on less resources</a>. The whole Midgard 2 architecture has been designed to be faster right from the beginning, but many improvements have happened also in the old, stable Midgard branch:
</p><ul><li><a href="http://teroheikkinen.iki.fi/blog/building_a_user_level_caching_with_dynamic_content/">Caching full page contents</a></li>
<li>Serving file attachments via <a href="http://teroheikkinen.iki.fi/blog/midcom_3_supports_now_x-sendfile/">X-Sendfile</a> or a separate Lighttpd installation</li>
<li>Switching <a href="http://trac.midgard-project.org/ticket/34">from Prototype javascript framework to jQuery</a>, which can then be <a href="http://trac.midgard-project.org/ticket/638">served via Google</a></li>
<li>Lots of performance improvements via autoloading and other features enabled by <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/next_midgard_will_be_php5_only/">dropping support for PHP4</a></li>
</ul><p>
<span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>Rebirth of the OpenPSA project</strong></span>
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.openpsa.org/version2/">OpenPSA</a>, the management software package for consultancies originally developed by <a href="http://nemein.com/en/">Nemein</a> had fallen out of maintenance during 2007. Proving the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/real-world_example_of_a_free_software_project_handover/">resilience of free software</a> projects, the <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/free_software_at_work-openpsa2_is_making_a_return/">project was reborn</a> in 2008, thanks to efforts of Andreas Flack from <a href="http://www.contentcontrol-berlin.de/">Content Control</a>.
</p><p>
During autumn the software was largely refactored to fit the Ragnaroek architecture, and a new major release will be coming soon out as part of other Ragnaroek releases. After this OpenPSA should be more visually appealing, significantly faster, and generally more usable.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size:14pt;"><strong>And a personal view</strong></span>
</p><p>
For me personally 2008 was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/archives/date-posted/2008/calendar/">also quite hectic</a>... I spent <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/bergie">a lot of time traveling</a> between conferences and almost <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/part-time_istanbullu/">moved to Istanbul</a> and <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/not_everything_goes_according_to_plan/">then didn't</a>. The new year we <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/3156228926/">welcomed in Rome</a> in a quite random company, of which there will be another post later.
