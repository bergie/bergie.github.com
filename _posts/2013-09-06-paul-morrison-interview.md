[J. Paul Morrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Morrison) invented [Flow-Based Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) while at IBM in 1969.

I ran into the concept [in 2011](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/interview-noflo-origins/) while trying to figure out a better way to create software. I read [his canonical book](http://amzn.com/1451542321) on the subject, and decided to try and implement it in JavaScript. Thus, [NoFlo](https://noflojs.org/) got started.

It has been an honor to have Paul as a mentor in the process. In late June 2013 we flew to Toronto to meet him. What resulted was quite a thorough code review of NoFlo's FBP implementation, and a video interview. The [interview with Paul](https://youtu.be/up2yhNTsaDs) is finally online. Enjoy!

If you want to meet Paul in person, the next opportunity will be in the [Toronto Flow-Based Programming meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-GTA-Flow-Based-Programming-Meetup/) on September 11th. On the same week we also have [my NoFlo talk in Zurich](http://techup.ch/1209/webtuesday-noflo-flow-based-programming-for-javascript) on the 10th, and [Forrest's talk in Berlin](http://2013.jsconf.eu/) on the 14th.

*In other news, the [NoFlo Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment) just hit 96%. Please help us get it funded so we can bring better flow-based tools to designers and programmers everywhere!*
