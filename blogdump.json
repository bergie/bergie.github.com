I've found that since starting to get my news updates through RSS my actual web browsing has dropped to maybe 20% of what is was, while I actually get much more useful information than I used to.<br \/><br \/>Many of the RSS feeds I subscribe to are profilic <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gladwell.com\/tp_excerpt2.html\">Connectors<\/a>, who specialize in sharing information on different IT and web topics. In addition, there are some special interest topics like motorcycling and Change Logs of software projects I participate to. I also follow some special areas like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/planet-oscom\/\">OSCOM<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.planet-php.net\/\">PHP<\/a> by subscribing to their Planet combination feeds.<br \/><br \/>The RSS aggregator works on the background, refreshing information from the feeds on a regular schedule. Every morning or lunch break I can go through the overview of new posts, and read the interesting ones.<br \/><br \/>Quite many blogs nowadays provide the full post content in their RSS feed, so I can read it even offline.

For example, quite many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/midcom\/\">MidCOM<\/a> components already provide RSS output by default.<br \/><br \/>When most CMSs and news sites are providing good quality RSS content, getting users on the board should be quite trivial. However, as Jon Udell pointed out, there are still issues left to solve:<br \/><ul><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Politics<\/span> - End users are not interested in whether a feed is RSS 0.9, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 or Atom.

All desktop RSS aggregators should be able to support the same URL type for subscription. In addition, all feeds should be available under the same term or icon, regardless of their type. Maybe <a href=\"http:\/\/usefulinc.com\/edd\/blog\/contents\/2003\/07\/22-rssautodetect\/read\">RSS autodetection<\/a> and hooking up with the web browser will help here<\/li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Explanation<\/span> - The concept is new, and so we have to wait until mass media gets it explained to the general public.

What is the organization aim?<\/span><br \/><br \/>OSCOM has two purposes, marketing and technical. On the marketing side, we aim to raise the public awareness in the availability and feasibility of Open Source Content Management Systems. This is what our first conferences focused on, and the reason why we maintain the CMS Matrix. On their own the different OSCMS projects do not have the weight required for reaching the mainstream users. However, with a central organization like OSCOM it is possible.<br \/><br \/>On the technical side we aim to improve the different Open Source CMSs, and get them to interoperate. We see that there are different phases of Content Management implementations, and at some of these phases a different CMS might be the optimal solution. Implementation of common standards makes it easier for users to switch It also reduces the need to waste effort by reinventing the wheel across all the projects.<br \/><br \/>The main activity on the technical side is arranging interoperability implementation events, Sprints, where people from different Open Source CMS projects come to implement some common standard or tool into their project.<br \/><br \/>To support this OSCOM also hosts some Open Source tool projects, the latest of these being the <a href=\"http:\/\/kupu.oscom.org\/\">Kupu<\/a> XHTML editor and the <a href=\"http:\/\/bxe.oscom.org\/\">BXE<\/a> XML editor. The criteria for hosting such projects under the OSCOM brand is that they must be useful across many or all CMS projects.<br \/><br \/>We also provide a news aggregation system focused on topics of Open Source CMS interest named Planet OSCOM.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">WebDevMagazine: How can become a member of this organization and are you interested in covering new countries?<\/span><br \/><br \/>Members are selected from people participating actively in the OSCOM activities. The selection is done by the members of the association. To get involved with OSCOM, the easy first steps are:<br \/><ul><li>Subscribe the OSCOM mailing list<\/li><li>Start providing an OSCOM topic RSS feed from your website for Planet OSCOM<\/li><li>Participate in OSCOM events or projects<\/li><li>If you work with an Open Source CMS project, start working on implementing some of the OSCOM-endorsed standards and tools<\/li><\/ul>At the moment OSCOM mostly operates on an international basis. There also is a recently founded suborganization called OSCOM Germany, working to create OSCOM resources and materials focused on that language and area. Similar country organizations could be possible in other places as well, if there is enough interest.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">WebDevMagazine: Is the Microsoft an enemy for you (OSCOM)<\/span><br \/><br \/>As the provider of a proprietary CMS system, they certainly are a competitor to all the Open Source Content Management System projects.<br \/><br \/>However, with the arrival of .Net and Web Services Microsoft also seems to be opening up to common standards and interoperability. If this trend continues, Microsoft could even become a de-facto partner of the OSCOM community.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">WebDevMagazine: OSCOM meeting next year in Bulgaria, is this possible?<\/span><br \/><br \/>Well, we're certainly interested in finding good venues for the OSCOM Sprints and conferences. Eastern Europe could be a good place for such event, enabling us to tap into the large local Open Source developer community.<br \/><br \/>The key for arranging such an event would be to find a good local organizer partner, or arrange the OSCOM event as a track in an existing conference. This way we can keep the logistics at minimal and instead focus on putting together as good program as possible.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">WebDevMagazine: Please tell me more about you (hobby, ...etc)<\/span><br \/><br \/>I've been working with the web since 1994, and for the last six years have been involved with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a> project.

What the competing systems should do instead is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/matrix\/index.html\">evaluate<\/a> each others' strenghts and weaknesses objectively and embrace common protocols and standards for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.advogato.org\/article\/544.html\">interoperability<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>This interoperability would enable users to build their own &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/projects\/documentation\/midgard\/case-oscom\">Frankenstein CMS<\/a>&quot; by selecting best building blocks from different Open Source CMSs, or to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zope-europe.org\/articles\/200302\/replaceability\/view\">replace<\/a> an old solution as their needs evolve.<br \/><br \/>What would then be good interoperability targets? For example, to be honest, the standard <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/midcom\/components\/net.nemein.discussion\">discussion forum<\/a> component for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/cms\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a> sucks. Why are people not using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phpbb.com\/\">phpBB<\/a> instead, then?<br \/><br \/>The reasons for this are quite simple. While both run on the <abbr title=\"Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP\">LAMP<\/abbr> platform, it lacks integration in several areas:<br \/><\/p>\n<ul><li>It doesn't use Midgard's layout templates<\/li><li>Features like &quot;Latest comments&quot; or &quot;Comments on this page&quot; are difficult to pull from phpBB into a Midgard page<\/li><li>User accounts and permissions have to be managed separately<br \/><\/li><\/ul> <h2>Layout management<\/h2>Keeping layouts synchronized between different systems used to be difficult. However, as the new school of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mezzoblue.com\/archives\/2004\/04\/30\/a_roadmap_to\/\">standards based web design<\/a> is gaining popularity this problem can finally be solved.<br \/><br \/>Web site components do not have to carry any layout information, just provide a needed set of &lt;div \/&gt; elements. The actual layout can then be loaded dynamically as a separately and centrally managed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/Style\/CSS\/\">CSS<\/a> file.<br \/><br \/>Of course, the problem here is that every CMS and web script will still use its own set of class names and IDs. But maybe some conventions can be developed, like has been done in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csszengarden.com\/\">CSS Zen Garden<\/a>.<br \/><h2>Comments listing<\/h2>With the advent of syndication formats like <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.law.harvard.edu\/tech\/rss\">RSS<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intertwingly.net\/wiki\/pie\/FrontPage\">Atom<\/a>, sharing news or comments listings between different servers and CMSs has become really easy. The only thing we really have to ensure is that all the different systems provide RSS feeds of their content, support <a href=\"http:\/\/diveintomark.org\/archives\/2002\/05\/30\/rss_autodiscovery\">RSS auto-discovery<\/a> and make it easy to aggregate content from other sources into them.<br \/><br \/>This way a news posting done in the Midgard <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/midcom\/components\/de.linkm.newsticker\">newsticker<\/a> could easily list related posts from a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.planetplanet.org\/\">Planet<\/a> feed, and provide a &quot;comment on this page&quot; functionality that is actually served by phpBB.<br \/><h2>User management and authentication<br \/><\/h2>Sharing users and groups across different systems is not easy. While some universal and &quot;proper&quot; solutions like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gracion.com\/server\/whatldap.html\">LDAP<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectliberty.org\/\">Liberty<\/a> exist, they are generally too heavy to be practical. Centralized solutions like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.passport.net\/Consumer\/Default.asp?lc=1033\">Passport<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typekey.com\/\">TypeKey<\/a> are also ruled out because CMSs should be able to work self-sufficiently.<br \/><br \/>There have been some more lightweight but language-specific solutions like <a href=\"http:\/\/php.weblogs.com\/universal\">PHP-Universal<\/a>, but these are not interoperable enough for OSCOM purposes.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.foaf-project.org\/\">FOAF<\/a> import and export could be one way to share information about user accounts across systems. FOAF is an RDF-based XML format for describing people and their relations, which would sort also group and permission sharing. However, it doesn't solve the question of single sign-on.<br \/><h2>Link and media management<\/h2>Another typical problem is handling connections between links and media files between different systems. For example, if images used on a Plone site are managed in Midgard's photo gallery, how to enable users to select them in Plone's content editing UI?<br \/><br \/>The <a href=\"http:\/\/kupu.oscom.org\/\">Kupu<\/a> XHTML editor team has a good approach here. As their editor is used in several different CMSs, they had to come up with a <a href=\"http:\/\/codespeak.net\/svn\/kupu\/trunk\/kupu\/doc\/LIBRARIES.txt\">CMS-agnostic XML format<\/a> describing images and links available for the editor. These XML files could easily be pulled from all different CMS and web scripts running on the server and and parsed by Kupu into a nice &quot;Insert image&quot; dialogue.<br \/><br \/>This format should be made a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/standards\/\">CMS standard<\/a> endorsed by OSCOM.<br \/><h2>Wrap-up<br \/><\/h2>The basic premise here is that interop between Open Source CMSs and web scripts is possible and can bring huge benefits for the end-users. However, the interop standards should be lightweight and easy to implement. In addition, they should still allow the different systems to stay self-sufficient.<br \/><br \/>Supporting standards well could also gain lots of positive attention for a CMS project, much like <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> is now experiencing with <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.carthik.net\/vault\/2004\/05\/14\/movabletype-to-wordpress\/\">Movable Type migrations<\/a>.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/\">OSCOM<\/a> has a conference coming in fall.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/formin.finland.fi\/netcomm\/news\/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=18300&intIGID=0&intCatID=198&LAN=FI&contlan=&Thread=18300,&intThreadPosition=0\">travel bulletin on Georgia<\/a> issued by Foreign Ministry of Finland claims:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nFinnish citizens require a visa for entry. Visas can be bought from the airport when entering the country. Visas can also be bought from land borders of Georgia.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nHowever, I'm inclined to doubt this. Especially as Georgian embassies in <a href=\"http:\/\/georgia.embassyhomepage.com\/georgian_visa_georgian_embassy_london_uk.htm\">UK<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.georgiaemb.org\/ConsularDoc1.asp\">USA<\/a> don't say anything about it.<br \/><\/p>\n<p>I guess the best course of action is to apply for Russian and Ukrainian visas now. I should also get in touch with both the Georgian embassy in Moscow and my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/gallery\/croatia-2003\/IMG_3565.html\">Georgian contacts<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tacticaltech.org\/summersource\">Summer Source<\/a>, Nata and Taya.<br \/><\/p>\n<p>I'm not currently sure of whether to skip Armenia completely. While they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.armeniaforeignministry.am\/eVisa\/\">sell visas over the web<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/formin.finland.fi\/netcomm\/news\/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=18313&intIGID=0&intCatID=198&LAN=FI&contlan=&Thread=18313,&intThreadPosition=0\">travel bulletin on Armenia<\/a> tells that the border between Armenia and Turkey is closed. The history of that country would be very interesting, though.<br \/><\/p>\n<p>While researching this, I found a Finnish<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hut.fi\/~osihvone\/Minun%20Euraasiani\/Minun%20Euraasiani_Kvantti.htm\"> travel journal of a similar trip<\/a> done in 2002 with a car. Interesting story which also brings hope for actually accomplishing all the required paperwork. However, they also encountered some red tape:<br \/>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nAfter the good roads, tourists and gorgeous mountains of Turkey we crossed the Georgian border at night. The crossing involved a collection of dubious payments and intense arguing with bribe collecting border officials. (typical border crossing fees in East Europe include disinfection fees, road taxes, registration fees, car fees, fees for printing out documents, fees for the official to stamp a paper, fee for the border guard to open the final gate...)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>So far I've never had to bribe anybody when traveling in East Europe, but maybe I've been just lucky. Most border officials and cops also seem to consider <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/bikes\/triumph-legend\">my motorcycle<\/a> so cool that they don't bother with bribes.<br \/><\/p>\n<p>If everything goes well, the trip will start directly after <a href=\"http:\/\/2004.guadec.org\/\">GUADEC<\/a>.

The Framework provides services like authentication, templating and content storage. The actual Midgard applications are written on that foundation in PHP and stored in the Midgard database as pages and \"snippet\" objects.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/midcom\/\">MidCOM<\/a> functions as a component system written on the application layer. With MidCOM, the actual point applications, or components are written following a strict set of coding standards and stored in the Midgard snippet tree. The components must provide a standardized set of interfaces, and all input and output with them is controlled by the MidCOM framework.<br \/><br \/>The fact that all application code is stored in the database causes several problems, the topmost being lack of good development tools and difficulty of version control. Torben explains these points well in the \"Current problems\" section of the mRFC.<br \/><br \/>Additional issue is performance. A component framework is a big thing, and its services and interfaces require many code libraries to be loaded. It has been calculated that an average MidCOM page request causes 2000 database queries. With careful optimization we could probably get the number down to about 1300, but that is still a lot. If we move the libraries to file system, only database I\/O will be actual content and template queries. Also, if the code is stored in the file system, it can be compiled into faster byte code using tools like Zend Optimizer.<br \/><h2>Reasoning for the old way<\/h2>With all these issues, why did we do the illogical thing of putting our code into the database in the first place? The code snippet system was added to Midgard in the 1.4.0 cycle, and there were several reasons:<br \/><ul><li>At that time most Midgard applications were much smaller<\/li><li>Storage in Midgard database provides metadata support. Licensing information, documentation and icons can be stored into the code objects themselves<br \/><\/li><li>Code can be replicated together with the site data<\/li><li>Editing code does not require filesystem access<\/li><li>Permissions come from Midgard's group system<\/li><\/ul>An important consideration is also that the lack of file system access makes Midgard much more secure, as noted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\/ab.html\" title=\"Alexander Bokovoy, Midgard and Samba developer\">Alexander Bokovoy<\/a> in his <a title=\"Midgard 5th anniversary\" href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/midgard-5th-anniversary.html\">Midgard 5th anniversary<\/a> presentation. When the whole system accesses only the database, and even that only through the Midgard libraries, this cuts down the risk of security holes through bad coding. In its 5 years of history, there hasn't been a since publicized security hole in Midgard. And this even though many high-profile hacking targets like large organizations, military, financial institutions and governments run Midgard.<br \/><h2>Changing deployment models<\/h2>Back with Midgard 1.4.0 almost all Midgard applications were built in-house and were not distributed. This way version control of the code was more closely connected with the general staging\/live routines of the developers. For this the fact that code could be replicated with content was advantageous.<br \/><br \/>Now most applications like MidCOM and its components are being developed in centralized fashion by the Midgard Community. In this setup code is developed and tested on separate systems, and then release versions are deployed widely across production servers. This way version control of the code between a content staging and live is not so important, as both will share the same component versions, and will differ only in versions of templates, configuration and local code.<br \/><h2>Separated concepts<\/h2>Moving MidCOM to file system not only makes development easier, but will also make the separation of centralized \"system\" code and local scripts clearer. MidCOM and its components are a part of the Midgard Framework, and are installed by the system administrator and not modified by a site developer. The things that a site developer will modify will be local and specific to a website, organization or a server environment, and so are stored into the Midgard database. This includes local configurations, output templates and local scripts.<br \/><h2>The new way<\/h2>If mRFC 0006 gets implemented, all MidCOM core code and components will be developed just like any PHP application, using the file system and <a href=\"http:\/\/fi2.php.net\/include\/\" title=\"PHP include() function\">include()<\/a> statements. This means that version control and development will become substantially simpler.<br \/><br \/>However, what we lose there is the ability to install a whole MidCOM component or the framework from a single repligard .xml.gz file. I have proposed using the <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/\" title=\"PEAR - PHP Library Archive\">PEAR<\/a> installer for this, and Torben has promised to include it to the mRFC.<br \/><br \/>The PEAR installer uses an <a title=\"PEAR package.xml\" href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/manual\/en\/developers.packagedef.php\">XML configuration file<\/a> for defining the files shipping with a package, and enables server administrators to install new software with a single, Debian APT-like command regardless of the operating system. The <a title=\"PEAR installer documentation\" href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/manual\/en\/installation.cli.php\">PEAR installer<\/a> is available by default on PHP 4.3.0 and newer releases.<br \/><br \/>Using the common PHP installation methods of the PEAR community would make The Midgard Project far better connected with the PHP community in general and promote code sharing.<br \/><br \/>To promote this even further, the Midgard Community should fully embrace the <a title=\"PEAR Coding Standards\" href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/manual\/en\/standards.php\">PEAR Coding Standards<\/a>, and use the same code documentation tools.<br \/><br \/>Theoretically MidCOM <a title=\"MidCOM fits the PEAR criteria of applicable packages\" href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/manual\/en\/newmaint.when-to-contribute.php\">could even move<\/a> to the <a title=\"PEAR Package List\" href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/packages.php\">PEAR repository<\/a>, but it would probably be seen as too Midgard-specific by the PEAR community. It provides a quite generic component architecture, but all components and its methods like the URL parser depend heavily on the midgard-php extension.<br \/><h2>mRFC status<\/h2>Torben has still left the proposal to Draft state, and some things will have to be polished before it can be voted on.<br \/><br \/>If the mRFC passes the actual transition should be relatively simple. We can just use the Aegir FileSync AddOn to copy all code snippets of the MidCOM core and component directories to the file system, and then programmatically change all <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/snippet\/functions\/mgd_include_snippet.html\" title=\"PHP mgd_include_snippet() function\">mgd_include_snippet()<\/a> calls in the system to use MidCOM's internal $midcom-&gt;include() method.<br \/><br \/>The PEAR package description files should be easy to generate automatically. In addition, we should create a \"MidCOM uninstaller\" Repligard file that would include delete calls for all objects in the MidCOM 1.4.0 release.<br \/><br \/>The actual MidCOM sites will be easy to migrate, as most of them contain only a single <a title=\"Explanation of the MidCOM program flow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts\/midcom\/specs\/architecture\/flow.html\">mgd_include_snippet(\"\/midcom\/midcom\")<\/a> call. This could be either changed to a filesystem require() call, or the MidCOM system could ship a stub snippet for this.\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Updated 13:20:<\/span> There is some discussion about this on the <a href=\"http:\/\/marc.theaimsgroup.com\/?t=109463990400001&r=1&w=2\" title=\"Discussion on mRFC 0006 on midgard-dev\">midgard-dev mailing list<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Updated 2004-10-28:<\/strong> The vote on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/development\/mrfc\/0006.html\">mRFC 0006<\/a> passed today, so we can finally start implementation.\n<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/2004-09-09-000\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Getting used to the new office","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2004-09-09 10:01:32","atom:content":"<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img vspace=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Rambo in the office, photo taken with Nokia 6820\" src=\"\/attachment\/1c9911cd91578c9791796c44fea32890\/8526932e7ad4506c090017ea84c80793\/Rambo_in_the_office.jpg\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<\/p><p>\nWe had been &quot;practicing&quot; cohabitation with the two companies since early June, with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.innopoli.fi\/suomi\/innopoli2_main.htm\" title=\"Innopoli2 business park\">Innopoli2<\/a> office mostly serving as a mailbox, and so the move was quite painless.

(Geography) We have maybe the worst climate in the world. No real summer and last decent winter was -98.<br \/><br \/>\n\n2. (Technical knowledge) Only thing to be proud of is a company, that technically isn't finnish and abandoned its corecompetencies by selling the branch which manufactured rubber boots. Result: finnish are proud of mediocre cellphones, which are made in china and generally thought to be japanese.<br \/><br \/>\n\n3. (Culture) Our best placement in Eurovision song contest is 6th place from 70's. Luckily other europeans have decided, that there is no point to come to the contest every year, if you lose. So finnish singers have to embarrass themselves only once in two years.<br \/><br \/>\n\n4. (Food) Most of the recipes we have inherited from our grandparents are practically uneatable. Take m\u00e4mmi, traditional easter dish, for example. What kind of pervert would like to eat something that resembles shit of carnivorus animal after it has been laying on freezen walkway for two nights?<br \/><br \/>\n\n5.

The related <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tbray.org\/ongoing\/When\/200x\/2004\/05\/02\/Policy\">policies<\/a> and success stories were a good starting point for convincing other companies to do the same.\n<\/p><p>\nThe session of legal issues of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/\">Open Source<\/a> was also interesting, highlighting the recent German court ruling that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theage.com.au\/articles\/2004\/04\/20\/1082395838556.html?oneclick=true\">upheld GPL<\/a> and the risks arising from the fact that liability from neglecting potentially harmful issues in the software can't be waived with a license in most European countries.\n<\/p><p>\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/oscom4\/proposals\/tiki\">Tiki session<\/a> also provided some interesting ideas, including visually mapping a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wiki\">Wiki<\/a> using the <a href=\"http:\/\/graphviz.org\/\">Graphviz<\/a> package and rendering location information <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.tikiwiki.org\/tiki-index.php\">using<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/mapserver.gis.umn.edu\/\">MapServer<\/a> and its <a href=\"http:\/\/tikiwiki.org\/tiki-list_file_gallery.php?galleryId=7\">PHP extension<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\nWe're also discussing how to make <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/\">OSCOM<\/a> more visible and work better. Some ideas:\n<\/p><ul><li>Loosen the restrictions on getting feeds aggregated on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/planet-oscom\/\">Planet OSCOM<\/a> and try to get <a href=\"http:\/\/greg.abstrakt.ch\/archives\/2004\/10\/more_blogs_for.html\">more feeds<\/a> there.

The old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/midcom\/components\/net.nemein.rss.html\">net.nemein.rss<\/a> powered aggregator will be replaced by this after Christian has time to add some features and tweak the CSS to better shape.\n<\/p><p>\nThe big problem for Planet OSCOM has constantly been how to find more interesting feeds to be aggregated there. One solution there would be to use the relationship mapping features of <a href=\"http:\/\/frassle.rura.org\/\">Frassle<\/a> to find new relevant feeds. After some planning with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rura.org\/shimon\/\">Shimon Rura<\/a>, this could work in the following way:\n<\/p><ul><li>Planet OSCOM sends its list of subscriptions every night to Frassle in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opml.org\/\">OPML<\/a> format<\/li><li>Frassle would download and parse the feeds, and try to find related content (based on common links)<\/li><li>Frassle would return a list of new feeds found to Planet OSCOM, which would automatically subscribe to them<\/li><\/ul><p>\nThis would all require a bit of hacking, both in adding import\/export capabilities to Frassle and in ensuring Planet OSCOM gets good feeds, but it would be a very interesting proof-of-concept for mapping related feeds. If it would work out, it could provide a model for all <a href=\"http:\/\/blogspace.com\/rss\/readers\">news aggregators<\/a> on how to find new content.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter the actual conference program we brainstormed with Thorsten Scherler to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/wiki\/\">OSCOM Wiki<\/a> about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/wiki\/cssnamingconventions\/\">CSS naming conventions<\/a> that would enable different designs to be used with same XHTML DIV structure.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the evening we had a nice dinner followed by quite a few beers in El Lokal, a leftist pirates' hideout styled place.

A major cause for that is duplication of effort. Everybody wants to build their own CMS and not improve the projects started by others, and so the wheel has been invented a huge amount of times. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/\">OSCOM<\/a> seeks us to improve that by advocating <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/2004-05-24-001.html\">collaboration<\/a> and usage of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/standards\/\">common standards<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\nLet's take a look at how the improvement recommendations apply to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a>:\n<\/p><blockquote><strong>Make it easy to install.<\/strong> Your tool will see better adoption if you stop to consider the out-of-the-box experience before you ship it.\n<\/blockquote><p>\nThis has traditionally been the weak point in Midgard. There have been many dependencies to solve and packages to compile. However, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/download\/1.6.0.html\">Midgard 1.6.0<\/a> is a big improvement to this.\n<\/p><p>\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/debian\/README\">Debian packages<\/a> made by Piotras and Daniel's packages for most <a href=\"http:\/\/people.best-off.org\/~dsr\/cubelog\/archives\/2004\/09\/29\/seeking-testers\/\">RPM based distributions<\/a> made with  <a href=\"http:\/\/people.best-off.org\/~dsr\/cubelog\/archives\/2004\/05\/03\/building-a-buddy-part-1\/\">Build Buddy<\/a> will make the actual installation very easy and having MidCOM environment available out-of-the-box helps too. \n<\/p><blockquote><strong>Make it easy to get started.<\/strong> Give first-time users a series of quick wins that become increasingly complex. When I first log in, I want to create a Web page.\n<\/blockquote><p>\nEven after installation it has been difficult to figure out how to get started. Now  MidCOM and Aegir are bundled in the midgard-data package and so the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/getting-started\/\">Getting Started<\/a> guide should be easy to follow. Midgard 1.6.0 also provides a friendly <a href=\"http:\/\/cvs.devel.midcom-project.org\/midgard\/\">Welcome Page<\/a>.\n<\/p><p> \nOn a longer term there will also be the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/development\/mrfc\/0007.html\">Midgard Site Creation Wizard<\/a>.\n<\/p><blockquote><strong>Write task-based documentation first.<\/strong> Most systems have installation instructions that are quite good: \"First do this, then do this, this, and this.\" But when it comes to actually using the CMS, they revert to feature-based docs, carefully outlining what each feature does, and typically from a back-end perspective.\n<\/blockquote><p>\nWe're mainly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts\/\">guilty as charged<\/a>. The new documentation chapters <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/getting-started\/\">Getting Started<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/howto\/\">Using Midgard CMS<\/a> seek to help with this, though.\n<\/p><blockquote><strong>Separate the administration of the CMS from the editing and managing of content.<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>\nMidgard does this already. MidCOM <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts\/midcom\/specs\/subsystems\/ais.html\">Authoring Interface System<\/a> (AIS) is the end-users' content management interface that is provided as part of the website itself. For site developers and administrators there is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/aegir\/\">Aegir<\/a> interface which provides access to users, templates and code.\n<\/p><blockquote><strong>Users of a public web site should never - never - be presented with a way to log into the CMS.<\/strong><\/blockquote><p>\nThis really depends of preferences. Maintainers of small business websites like to have the login link handy so they don't have to remember or bookmark it, whereas bigger organizations usually want to hide it, and potentially disable access to the editing interface from public network completely.\n<\/p><p>\nIn MidCOM Site Template there are three possibilities here, depending on site settings (\/midcom-admin\/settings):\n<\/p><ul><li>Login link is always displayed (default)<\/li><li>Login link is never displayed<\/li><li>Login link is displayed only for specific port (internal staging port, SSL etc)<\/li><\/ul><blockquote><strong>Stop it with the jargon already.<\/strong> I don't know what a portlet is. Or a component, module, block, or snippet.<\/blockquote><p>\nGood point. Being mostly techies themselves, CMS developers usually fall into using jargon. And since there is no standardized vocabulary for content management, the jargon may vary greatly between projects. Jargon should not be allowed in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/cms\/\">marketing descriptions<\/a> for the CMSs, and even elsewhere it should be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/glossary\/\">documented<\/a> or accompanied with a description.\n<\/p><blockquote><strong>Why do you insist Web sites have \"columns\"?<\/strong> I've used quite a few systems now that have the notion of a 3-column layout. They give me the ability to turn columns off and on, and put \"portlets\" into \"content-slots\". Where does this assumption come from?\n<\/blockquote><p>\nThe three-column layout is a very typical convention in blog engines, community CMSs and portal systems modeled after <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/\">Slashdot<\/a>. Most real CMSs provide a less cookie-cutter like approach.\n<\/p><p><strong>In other news<\/strong>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\/pp.html\">Piotras<\/a> reported that according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.securityspace.com\/s_survey\/data\/index.html\">SecuritySpace Survey<\/a>, Midgard usage grew 40% during September.

To complement it, here is my list of talking points:\n<\/p><p><strong>MgdSchema<\/strong> is the new object abstraction back-end for Midgard proposed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\/ab.html\">Alexander<\/a> and being developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\/pp.html\">Piotras<\/a>. With MgdSchema the Midgard content types would be defined using XML schemas instead of hardcoded into the Midgard libraries. While <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/midcom\/\">MidCOM<\/a> datamanager already allows site developers to freely define their own content types, their storage using Midgard's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/parameter\/\">parameters<\/a> API causes performance issues.\n<\/p><p>\nThe new model would solve the performance problem by translating schemas into database tables when Midgard is loaded. It would also make Midgard object types accessible from other programming languages by using the libdba and GObject technologies from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/\">GNOME<\/a> project. Alexander was able to create <a href=\"http:\/\/www.python.org\/\">Python<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ruby-lang.org\/en\/\">Ruby<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mono-project.com\/\">.Net\/Mono<\/a> bindings to his proof of concept during the Poznan meeting.\n<\/p><p><strong>mRFC 0008<\/strong> was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/development\/mrfc\/0008.html\">passed<\/a> this week, we also have to talk about implementing the new Midgard release process. I want to have a list of TODO items assigned to people by the time we leave Link\u00f6ping. So far I see the following items:\n<\/p><ul><li>Set up the Midgard release calendar to midgard-project.org<\/li><li>Create a translators' area on the site<\/li><ul><li>Consolidate and update translation instructions for Aegir, MidCOM and Spider<\/li><li>Start gathering a list of translators with their assigned languages<\/li><li>Create a report showing completion percentages for the different translations<\/li><\/ul><li>Schedule a \"translation test drive\" to try to get a number of languages to an acceptable 60-70% level<\/li><li>Work out how to migrate 1.6 installations for the new filesystem-based MidCOM in 1.7<\/li><\/ul><p>\nSince Piotras is attending, we will also take a look at solving the Midgard Core bug affecting the <strong>net.nemein.registrations<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/components\/net.nemein.registrations.html\">component<\/a>. The new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/other\/mgd_debug_start\">mgd_debug_*<\/a> functions in Midgard <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/midgard_1_6_0__swedengard__released.html\">1.6<\/a> should make that easier.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Updated 2004-11-12 from Link\u00f6ping:<\/strong> Due to AnyKey's designer <a href=\"http:\/\/robert.techcommons.info\/\">Robert Renling<\/a> being linked with the <a href=\"http:\/\/gnomejournal.org\/\/\">GNOME Journal<\/a> community, another important focus point for the gathering will be discussion on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/\">GNOME<\/a> integration. As MgdSchema will essentially bring GNOME technologies to the server it would make sense to get the two communities communicate. The Open Source desktop severely needs server and groupware integration, and Midgard can help there.\n<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/new_look_at_nemeinquiz\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"New look at NemeinQuiz","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2004-11-11 13:00:40","atom:content":"<p>\nNemeinQuiz is an online exam tool originally developed for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/news\/press\/pharmaceutical-info-elearning.html\">Pharmaceutical Information Centre<\/a> for their pharmaceutical sales <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laaketietokeskus.fi\/showPage.php?page_id=62\">courses<\/a>.\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">We<\/a> published the <a title=\"click to download NemeinQuiz\" href=\"http:\/\/devel.nemein.net\/nightly\/quiz.xml.gz\">package<\/a> as Open Source with some quick <a href=\"http:\/\/marc.theaimsgroup.com\/?l=midgard-user&m=106801122401047&w=2\">setup instructions<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile setting up a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/cms\/\">Midgard<\/a>-powered site for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kyweb.fi\/\">Student Union of Helsinki School of Economics<\/a> (KY), I decided to take another look at NemeinQuiz to see how well it would integrate into the MidCOM template site as the online questionnaire.\n<\/p><p>\nSome quick screenshots how it looks like (in Finnish, sorry):\n<\/p><p align=\"center\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"202\" border=\"0\" title=\"Filling the questionnaire\" alt=\"ky-quiz-fill.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-24e47c05769cf0248c80e4c17510663e\/ky-quiz-fill.jpg\" \/><\/p><p align=\"center\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"130\" border=\"0\" title=\"Questionnaire statistics\" alt=\"ky-quiz-stats.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-44a3d73be06ef7c5823e80d6cd7deded\/ky-quiz-stats.jpg\" \/><\/p><p>\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/marc.theaimsgroup.com\/?l=midgard-user&m=106801122401047&w=2\">old instructions<\/a> were mostly valid for usage with MidCOM as well.

On sunday night we went to see a performance of Verdi's <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aida\">Aida<\/a> opera in the old theatre. A very traditionalistic performance where carpenters started hammering the set together every time the curtains fell. Before the opera we dined in an Uzbek restaurant.\n<\/p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-f0dbeb404e2912533f2454f94b2f73eb\/Lviv_Aida.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"201\" width=\"349\" alt=\"Lviv_Aida.jpg\" title=\"Verdi's Aida in Lviv opera\" \/><\/p><p>\nThe only thing shadowing the gathering was the Ukrainian <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ukrainian_presidential_election%2C_2004\">presidential elections<\/a> held during on sunday. As  <a href=\"http:\/\/washingtontimes.com\/op-ed\/20041123-080537-6853r.htm\">reported<\/a> by all major news outlets, the elections were heavily rigged for the ruling party's <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Viktor_Yanukovych\">candidate<\/a>, and civil unrest was feared as a result.\n<\/p><p>\nWe caught the first signs of the unrest in sunday evening. All ATMs had been emptied of cash and marked squares were filled with muttering groups in their fur hats. In the opera an old woman asked from us with tears in her eyes why we had come there in such sad times.\n<\/p><p>\nNext morning I escorted the girls to the railway station and airport at 6 am, early enough to avoid most of the demonstrations. When I returned to the center they had already started. The hotel keeper pointed out to the Rynok squere and commented laconically: \"Revoluzija\". I decided to take a closer look, and spent next hours in an old Austrian-style cafe overlooking the Svoboda street where most of the supporters of the opposition candidate, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Viktor_Yushchenko\">Yushchenko<\/a> were gathered.\n<\/p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-52580483b6f1e8188278a49d0b059907\/Lviv_demonstration.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"122\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Lviv_demonstration.jpg\" title=\"Demonstration on prospekt Svoboda, Lviv\" \/><\/p><p>\nThe demonstrations stayed quite peaceful during monday, and I got my plane to Vienna in the afternoon. At the same time black cars were ferrying businesspeople to their private jets out from the city. Since then, the situation has escalated quite a bit, with city of Lviv refusing to accept the election results, and reputedly barricades being constructed on the National Square of Kyiv. Having seen the situation develop, I will definitely monitor the <a href=\"http:\/\/news.google.com\/?hl=en&ncl=http:\/\/washingtontimes.com\/world\/20041123-112457-2697r.htm\">news<\/a> about it.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Updated 2004-12-27:<\/strong> After weeks of demonstrations and international attention, the Ukrainians held new elections yesterday.

As in all service industries, the big question is the standard investor question of \"How do you make money while you sleep?\"<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">We've<\/a> been thinking about this for a while, considering different growth strategies. One model that would seem very viable is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Franchising\">franchising<\/a>. According to WikiPedia:<\/p><blockquote>\nFranchising is a method of doing business wherein a franchisor licenses trademarks and methods of doing business to a franchisee in exchange for a recurring royalty fee.\n<\/blockquote><p>\nIn our case this would mean giving other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> consultancies the right to use the Nemein brand and working model in their operations. In return, they would pay a franchising royalty to us. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldfranchising.com\/industry.htm\">World Franchising<\/a>, this royalty is typically 3-6% of revenue.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat would be the benefits to the franchisor? There are several:\n<\/p><ul><li>Established name in Midgard solutions<\/li><li>Strong client portfolio<\/li><li>Direct technical support from several main developers of Midgard<\/li><li>Good <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">management systems<\/a> and clear <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/company\/it.html\">IT policy<\/a><\/li><li>Training period on working models together with the Nemein team<\/li><li>Clear technology strategy<\/li><li>Marketing and sales support<\/li><\/ul><p>\nFor the clients this would also be an advantage as they could be sure they're getting real Midgard competence. From a chat with a potential franchisee:\n<\/p><blockquote>\nThe idea with all this is that we can work together more efficiently and that clients will have a consistent experience. Essentially the big mac will taste the same everywhere.\n<\/blockquote><p>\nBeing less risky than starting overseas offices, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.franchise.org\/resourcectr\/partVI.asp\">this model<\/a> is certainly very compelling. We are now piloting the approach with two companies, one in an established western market, and one in an emerging CMS market. If this works out, we might soon see the golden arches of Midgard spread around the world.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Updated 2005-01-03<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/hiisi.fi\/blog\/post\/2004\/12\/28\/free-software-franchising\/\">Hiisi.fi comments<\/a> <em>\"Not a bad idea.

Since I didn't want to get a desktop system, I took one of the old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">company<\/a> HP Omnibook 500 laptops and set up Linux on it. This gave me a perfect opportunity to try the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ubuntulinux.org\/\">Ubuntu<\/a> distribution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first installation was a problem because the system had some data from an old Red Hat 8 installation that I wanted to preserve. Ubuntu refused to install on the existing filesystem, and only worked after I copied the data to my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/ibook\/\">iBook<\/a> and let the Ubuntu installer format the hard drive. Other than that the installation was very smooth. Ubuntu probed all the hardware correctly, including my D-Link WLAN card and the display. However, on startup X refused to work.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo solve this I had to manually install the <strong>xserver-xfree86<\/strong> and <strong>xbase-fonts<\/strong> packages.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter that the system has behaved nicely, presenting a very attractive desktop with a good set of tools preinstalled, including Firefox and Openoffice.org. The only problem that still lingers is that the Omnibook display tends to turn white after a while of use. This is a <a href=\"http:\/\/forums1.itrc.hp.com\/service\/forums\/bizsupport\/questionanswer.do?admit=716493758+1101911846209+28353475&threadId=121645\">known hardware problem<\/a> apparently caused by loose display connector.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/attachment\/1c9911cd91578c9791796c44fea32890\/7eae2249b6b4400b67cd1bb4197e0846\/ubuntu-desktop-20041201.jpg\" \/>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Blogging on GNOME<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHaving a new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/\">GNOME<\/a> installation in front of me allowed me to finally test the blogging functionality of the desktop.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy default Ubuntu doesn't include any blog-related tools, but they were easily available from the universe repository. Simply edit the <em>\/etc\/apt\/sources.list<\/em> file and uncomment the two lines pointing to universe. You can probably also enable them in the Repositories window of Synaptic.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter editing the APT sources list, I fired up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nongnu.org\/synaptic\/\">Synaptic package manager<\/a>, which is the default package installation tool for Ubuntu. The three packages relevant to blogging were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imendio.com\/projects\/blam\/\">blam<\/a>, an RSS news reader, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/~seth\/gnome-blog\/\">gnome-blog<\/a>, a simplistic blog poster and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogtk.sourceforge.net\/\">blogtk<\/a>, a slightly more comprehensive weblog editor.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Blam<\/strong> is an RSS news reader. It uses a three-pane layout where the subscribed channels and their unread item counts are shown on left, headlines of current channel on top and the content at the bottom. Blam also adds a notification icon to the GNOME panel reporting when new items are available. Unfortunately Blam doesn't do too well in comparison to the popular Mac OS X newsreader, <a href=\"http:\/\/ranchero.com\/netnewswire\/\">NetNewsWire<\/a>. The UI feels much clunkier and simple tasks like removing multiple subscribed feeds are not possible. <a href=\"http:\/\/ranchero.com\/netnewswire\/features\/externalEditors.php\">Integration with desktop blogging tools<\/a> is also missing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/attachment\/1c9911cd91578c9791796c44fea32890\/9e635cf18324a5666c74bbb1999d0aba\/blam.jpg\" \/>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe blogging tools, <strong>gnome-blog<\/strong> and <strong>BloGTK<\/strong> also fare quite badly against the common Mac OS X or Windows tools for the task like <a href=\"http:\/\/ranchero.com\/marsedit\/\">MarsEdit<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/ecto.kung-foo.tv\/\">ecto<\/a>. Neither application supported <a href=\"http:\/\/archipelago.phrasewise.com\/stories\/storyReader$1330\">RSD auto-probing<\/a> of MetaWebLog settings, or uploading of attachments using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xmlrpc.com\/metaWeblogApi#metaweblognewmediaobject\">metaWeblog.newMediaObject<\/a> API. Gnome-blog aims to be a quick tool for blogging notes, and its simplistic interface integrated with the GNOME panel fits this paradigm well. However, with BloGTK the editing of existing posts has been needlessly hidden under a menu item. The <a href=\"http:\/\/ranchero.com\/images\/marsedit\/marseditMainScreenshot.png\">email-like paradigm<\/a> used by MarsEdit would work much better, as would initiating the edit calls from Blam.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/attachment\/1c9911cd91578c9791796c44fea32890\/f29e2d41ba84f0cb679c307736a79999\/gnome-blog.jpg\" \/>\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Note:<\/strong> There was an issue preventing the GNOME desktop blogging tools from being used with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a>.

They are able to manage growth and larger projects by networking with other similar units, which again can network with other units. This all forms a fine mesh of interconnected and dedicated companies which should be able to react more swiftly to changes of business climate.\n<\/p><p>\nThis concept should sound familiar to most readers of my blog. While <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">Nemein<\/a> slightly exceeds the maximum size of a nanocorp, our operational model still closely resembles it. We focus very tightly on building web based information systems on top of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> platform. To provide more complete solutions we then work together with individual programmers, graphical designers, media consultancies and hosting providers. Most of these are also companies of similar scale and working model.\n<\/p><p>\nThe big question is how to manage projects efficiently when such a big number of subcontractors are involved. In most cases this is handled by setting up a single project area in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPSA<\/a> where all are given accounts. However, this forces the contractors to manage the work using <em>our<\/em> system instead of <em>their own<\/em>.\n<\/p><p>\nI'm now trying to figure out a good way to handle this so that each organization could manage their part using whatever management system they prefer, but so that all could also see the work being done by others. For now this could be called a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Keiretsu\">Keiretsu<\/a> model.\n<\/p><p>\nThe basic idea is that we should have a technology-neutral but tightly specified API systems could use for communicating with each other. To make things easy we could build it on top of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xmlrpc.com\/\">XML-RPC layer<\/a>. When such API would be available it would then be up to the different systems to implement it. As support from larger financial or ERP systems is highly unlikely, plugins could be developed by third parties.\n<\/p><p>\nThe API should be relatively generic:\n<\/p><ul><li>Project Management<\/li><ul><li>List projects or tasks<\/li><li>Modify a project or task<\/li><li>Create a project or task<\/li><li>List hours reported to a task<\/li><li>Add hour report to a task<\/li><\/ul><li>Sales<\/li><ul><li>List sales projects<\/li><li>Modify a sales project<\/li><li>Create a sales project<\/li><li>List contacts in a sales project<\/li><li>Modify a contact in sales project<\/li><li>Add a contact to sales project<\/li><li>List activities in a sales project<\/li><li>Modify an activity in sales project<\/li><li>Add an activity to sales project<\/li><\/ul><li>Support<\/li><ul><li>List support tickets<\/li><li>Modify a support ticket<\/li><li>Create a support ticket<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><p>\nAll operations would be run with an user account, letting the system in the other end handle access control. This would also allow desktop tools to utilize the same API for communicating with the server. For example, it would be easy to imagine <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imendio.com\/projects\/planner\/\">GNOME Planner<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/linas.org\/linux\/gtt\/gtt.html\">Gnome Time Tracker<\/a> communicating this way with back-end project management systems.\n<\/p><p>\nFor calendaring an existing API like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hut.fi\/u\/asaarila\/syncml\/syncml_intro.html\">SyncML<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opengroupware.org\/people\/hh\/draft-hess-groupdav-01.txt\">GroupDAV<\/a> could work better.\n<\/p><p><strong>As a side note<\/strong>, nanocorporation seems to be a fairly new word. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.fi\/search?hl=fi&q=nanocorporation&btnG=Google-haku&meta=\">Google lists<\/a> only 19 hits.

This would rid Helsinki of its only airport accessible to smaller planes and effectively kill a whole branch of Finnish aviation industry.\n<\/p><h2>Threat to aviation and security<\/h2><p>\nClosing Helsinki-Malmi would remove Finland of its second-busiest airport. In addition to being a busy private and small aviation airport, Helsinki-Malmi is also the main center for pilot training in Finland. In the unifying Europe travel and communications are increasing in importance. Especially to remote countries like Finland it is very urgent to ensure a smoothly operating flight industry in order to not get isolated from centers of politics and commerce. This is not viable if flight training has to be dispersed to more remote and expensive locations.\n<\/p><p>\nHelsinki-Malmi also operates as the secondary airport to Helsinki-Vantaa in case of strikes or catastrophes. If Helsinki-Vantaa would be temporarily closed for some reason, like it was during a strike in late 80s, Helsinki-Malmi provides a convenient location. Routing the flights in such situation to Pirkkala or some other airport would make air travel difficult.\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition to the hard values, Helsinki-Malmi is an important recreational area for citizens of Helsinki. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laskuvarjokerho.com\/site\/page.php?pid=19\">Parachutists<\/a>, private aviators and flight enthusiasts would lose the only location for their hobby near the capital. Closing Malmi would make Helsinki one of the few <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelastamalmi.org\/en\/reading\/misconceptions.html#four\">major European cities<\/a> not accessible by smaller aircraft.\n<\/p><p>\nHelsinki-Malmi is also an important base for rescue helicopters and the Finnish border guard. The state has recently made huge investments into the border guard helicopter base in EFHF, and these investments would now be lost.\n<\/p><h2>Historical value<\/h2><p>\nAs one of the few operational examples of 30s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Functionalism_%28architecture%29\">functionalist<\/a> architecture, and such <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wmf.org\/html\/programs\/finhel.html\">is listed<\/a> as one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wmf.org\/html\/programs\/watchlist2004.html#EE\">100 most endangered sites<\/a> by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wmf.org\/\">World Monuments Fund<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the previous main airport of Helsinki, Helsinki-Malmi has also played its part in several <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelastamalmi.org\/en\/reading\/history.html\">events in Finnish history<\/a>. It has housed Finnish and German fighters protecting Helsinki from Soviet bombers in WWII, and was the site where <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carl_Gustaf_Emil_Mannerheim\">Mannerheim's<\/a> funeral procession started.\n<\/p><p>\nThe value of Helsinki-Malmi is not only in the round terminal building, but in the whole, functioning airport milieu. Destroying that would be irreversible and completely pointless. It reminds of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.photogrammetry.ethz.ch\/research\/bamiyan\/buddha\/destruction.html\">other cases<\/a> where regimes have destroyed important heritage for the purpose of vanity.\n<\/p><h2>Unrealistic housing plans<\/h2><p>\nMalmi was originally selected as the site of the new Helsinki airport contrary to recommendation from pilot hero <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charles_Lindbergh\">Charles Lindbergh<\/a> because of its unsuitability for housing. The whole airport has been built on top of a swamp, making the construction process very expensive. In the end a new main airport had to be constructed to Pakkala because the landing strips couldn't take the weight of new, heavier passenger aircraft.\n<\/p><p>\nThe swamp would make house construction too expensive to be viable still today. The city planning council is proposing development of small private apartments to the area. The heavy-duty foundations required when building on such area to prevent houses from sinking would make the apartments very expensive. \n<\/p><p>\nAt the same time there are several far more suitable locations available nearby. Only few kilometers northeast of the airport begin the drier forests of Sipoo. In addition, the city is gaining new housing areas as Port of Helsinki moves to the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vuosaarensatama.fi\/en\/\">Vuosaari harbour<\/a>. There are also plans to evict the military from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.santahamina.fi\/\">Santahamina<\/a> island just few kilometers from the center.\n<\/p><p>\nThis all proves that Helsinki is not running out of viable construction space. And it has to be also noted that the population numbers in the capital have been shrinking lately, even further removing the need for new housing.\n<\/p><h2>Dubious legality<\/h2><p>\nHelsinki-Malmi was rented to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ilmailulaitos.fi\/home\">Civil Aviation Administration<\/a> for 99 years back in the 30s. Now the City of Helsinki wants to evict them on the clause that the airport must be used for civil aviation. For some reason City of Helsinki chooses not to recognize that private aviation and flight training are also counted as civil aviation. This is a very dubious legal standpoint.\n<\/p><p>\nThe democratic commitment of the city must also be questioned. The decision and talks about the future of Malmi were pointedly scheduled after the recent city council elections, and all major parties declined to comment the issue. This is understandable as the city wants to close the airfield against the will of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelastamalmi.org\/en\/reading\/gallup.html\">vast majority of residents of Helsinki<\/a>. This is not how democracy is supposed to work, but then again we live in another system called \"representational democracy\".\n<\/p><h2>Not too late to act<\/h2><p>\nThe current decision was only been a recommendation from the city planning council. The actual actions still have to be ratified by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hel.fi\/english\/decision\/council.html\">city council<\/a>. Apparently the decision will be made before Christmas.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not too late to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelastamalmi.org\/en\/index.html\">save Malmi<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelastamalmi.org\/en\/petition\/index.html\">Sign the petition<\/a>, contact your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hel.fi\/paatoksenteko\/valtujas.html#valtuutetut\">city councillor<\/a> and follow the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelastamalmi.org\/en\/news\/index.html\">news on the matter<\/a>.

This made the battery run out in less than a day, which was very irritating.\n<\/p><p>\nAs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kaukolaweb.com\/blog\/a_new_toy.html\">Kaukola had praised<\/a> the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sonyericsson.com\/K700\/index.aspx\">Sony Ericsson K700i<\/a> I decided to buy one for myself. Obviously the first thing I tried with it was synchronizing my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/ical\/\">calendar<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/macosx\/features\/addressbook\/\">contacts<\/a> with it using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/isync\/\">iSync<\/a>. Both had issues.\n<\/p><p><strong>Calendar synchronization<\/strong> worked without any major hurdles. The only big complaint is that it doesn't support timezones. My Mac is configured to be in the EET timezone (GMT +2), and so was my phone. Unfortunately the phone expected that the incoming events would be in GMT when they were in EET, and so moved all of them by two hours. This was solved by setting the phone to the GMT timezone, which is obviously not a pretty solution but has to pass for now.\n<\/p><p>\nOne theory on why this goes wrong is that the events in my calendar originate from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/openpsa\/calendar.html\">OpenPSA Calendar<\/a>, which doesn't add any timezone information to its vCal entries. Here's a typical entry:\n<\/p><pre>\nBEGIN:VEVENT\nUID:ead00e1735d94f14a5c21d1888a5c48f@midgard\nSUMMARY:Midgard site wizard\nCLASS:PUBLIC\nDTSTART:20041228T090000\nDTSTAMP:20041228T090000\nDTEND:20041228T180000\nDTCREATED;TZID=US-Eastern: 19700101T020000\nDTLAST-MODIFIED;TZID=US-Eastern: 19700101T020000\nCATEGORIES:MEETING\nLOCATION:Home\nEND:VEVENT\n<\/pre><p>\nI've posted <a href=\"http:\/\/openpsa.tigris.org\/issues\/show_bug.cgi?id=22\">bug #22<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPSA<\/a> about this and it has been fixed in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/news\/press\/openpsa_1_10_released.html\">1.10 release<\/a>.\n<\/p><p><strong>Contacts synchronization<\/strong> started out just fine, but somehow mystically broke overnight. When I tried to synchronize again this morning iSync aborted with some error. I then removed the K700i device from iSync, and re-added it. But then it created duplicates of all entries, so both my phone and my Mac had entries as \"firstname lastname\" and \"lastname firstname\".\n<\/p><p>\nI was able to delete all contacts from my phone and remove the duplicates from the Mac Address Book. However, even after this iSync persistently tried to \"salvage\" the duplicate entries from a Backup Conduit. After some struggle I decided to keep from synchronizing contacts between the two for now. Very aggravating! I've posted an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/feedback\/isync.html\">iSync bug<\/a> about this.\n<\/p><p><strong>In the other news<\/strong>, I've finally added <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/cms\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a> to the <a href=\"http:\/\/cmsmatrix.org\/\">CMS Matrix<\/a>.

To stress test the OpenPSA - iCal - K700i synchronization, I created a calendar reservation that mixed Scandinavian, Cyrillic and Georgian characters. Both OpenPSA and iCal showed them correctly, and the phone showed things correctly with the limitation that Ericsson hasn't installed Georgian fonts, so boxes were shown instead of those characters. Quite cool level of internationalization!\n<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/adding_location_awareness_to_blogs\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Adding location awareness to blogs","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2004-12-28 23:30:07","atom:content":"<p>\nI've today updated <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\">my blog<\/a> to display the location the post was made from.

It's so damn easy to use and install.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nAfter replying I realized we should probably explain the difference between Midgard and standalone <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/\">PHP<\/a> applications better.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWordPress is a great tool when it comes to blogging. It is indeed very easy to set up, and its user interface strives to be simple and user-friendly. While technically Midgard's blogging component, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/components\/de.linkm.newsticker.html\">de.linkm.newsticker<\/a> includes most of the same features like <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.law.harvard.edu\/tech\/rss\">RSS<\/a> output or <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/using_weblog_editors_with_midgard_cms.html\">desktop blogging tool<\/a> support, it still doesn't provide as good user experience. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/\">Installation<\/a> is much more involved, and more steps are needed for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/getting-started\/\">setting up the website<\/a>. The user interface is also more complex, with site management functionalities handled by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/aegir\/\">Aegir<\/a> and content creation by the on-site \"edit this page\" functionality.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSimilarly to WordPress, several other PHP applications like <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.menalto.com\/\">Gallery<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phpbb.com\/\">phpBB<\/a> are considered to be the best tools in their categories. Again Midgard has components like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/components\/net.siriux.photos.html\">net.siriux.photos<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/components\/net.nemein.discussion.html\">net.nemein.discussion<\/a> providing similar functionalities. And again they are slightly lacking in setup, functionality or user interface sense when compared to their pure-PHP counterparts.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut that is all beside the point of Midgard.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhile individual Midgard applications could be inferior to their pure-PHP brethen, their strength lies in sharing the common framework of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/framework\/\">Midgard CMF<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/projects\/midcom\/\">MidCOM<\/a>. And in many cases, the advantages of the framework vastly outdo the possible shortcomings of the applications themselves. Consider the following:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Templating<\/strong>. All Midgard applications run within the Midgard templating engine, allowing developers to easily provide common look-and-feel across different parts of their site. Midgard's templating engine was noted as the best in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/Features\/ProductWatch\/FeaturedProduct\/?feature_id=83\">Ideal CMS of 2002<\/a> chosen by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/\">CMS Watch<\/a><\/li>\n  <li><strong>Permissions<\/strong>. With Midgard all applications can share the same group-based permission definitions. For authentication there are several options like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/authentication.html\">PAM and NTLM single sign-on<\/a><\/li>\n  <li><strong>Hosting capability<\/strong>. A single Midgard installation can be shared between an unlimited number of organizations using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts\/sitegroups\/\">Sitegroups<\/a> virtual database system<\/li>\n  <li><strong>Performance<\/strong>. The Midgard core libraries have been written in C, and provide much more efficient Framework for CMS functionalities than interpreted PHP code or the typical <a href=\"http:\/\/faq.wordpress.net\/view.php?p=20\">htaccess hacks<\/a>. In addition, Midgard's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts\/repligard\/\">replication tools<\/a> make clustering very easy<\/li>\n  <li><strong>Configurability<\/strong>. With MidCOM's configuration engine all components provide an uniform way for changing their settings on either per-organization or per-directory basis<\/li>\n  <li><strong>Multiple instances<\/strong>. MidCOM components are bound to site directories instead of installations, and so the same application can be utilized in different parts of a website<\/li>\n  <li><strong>Security<\/strong>. Most Midgard applications use little or no filesystem access, and as far as I know none access the database directly. This means possible exploits can be prevented already at the Framework level<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nThese benefits should make it easy to choose between Midgard or the different PHP applications depending on what is needed. If only a single functionality, say blogging, is required, a tool like <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> wins the choice easily. It is simple to install, works on regular web hosting services, and has a very convenient user interface.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, if more than one set of functionality is needed, or there are plans for growth, then <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> is a better choice. With the slight initial cost of setting up a heavier system there is suddenly a much more robust framework and all its different integrated functionalities available.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAnother point to consider is that in addition to regular web publishing functionalities, the Midgard Framework also provides a set of business tools.

I've written this in response to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.privaterra.org\/blog-rg\/categories___midgard_blog.html\">Robert Guerra's questions<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\nMidgard CMS contains a powerful PHP-level data abstraction layer called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts\/midcom\/specs\/architecture\/\">datamanager<\/a>. With datamanager it is possible to freely modify the content fields and editing widgets used with any <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/components\/\">component<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first thing when adding new categories is to make the category field array. Robert's example was:\n<\/p><pre>\"category\" =&gt; array(\n  \"description\" =&gt; \"Category\",\n  \"datatype\" =&gt; \"text\",\n  \"location\" =&gt; \"parameter\",\n  \"widget\" =&gt; \"select\",\n  \"widget_select_choices\" =&gt; array (\n     \"Privaterra\" =&gt; \"Privaterra\",\n     \"Midgard\" =&gt; \"Midgard\",\n     \"Travel\" =&gt; \"Travel\",\n     \"Security\" =&gt; \"Security\",\n   ),\n),\n<\/pre><p>\nWhile I would use more descriptive keys than <em>cat1<\/em> for the categories, the actual field definition looks correct.\n<\/p>\nWhat you need to do next is to copy the default de.linkm.newsticker\nschema from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/components\/de.linkm.newsticker.html\">component API reference<\/a> and add your own field\ndefinition there.\n<\/p><p>\nit is the area starting with:\n<pre>\"default\" =&gt; array (\n    \"name\"        =&gt; \"default\",\n    \"description\" =&gt; \"News Article\",\n...\n<\/pre><p>\nCopy that area into a text editor (or just your clip board), and\nadd the category block you've made into the \"fields\" array. A\ngood place to do that would be between \"title\" and \"abstract\".\n<\/p><p>\nThen you need to store this new schema definition into your Midgard\nsetup as a snippet.\n<\/p><p>\nGo to Aegir, select the \"Snippet\" tab from the left, and create\na snippet directory named \"sitegroup-config\". Then under that create\nanother snippet directory named \"de.linkm.newsticker\" by clicking\n\"New\" on the right-hand frame's menu.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the default location used for MidCOM's configuration. You don't \nneed to follow that convention but I'd recommend it.\n<\/p><p>\nNow that you have the snippetdirs created, click \"New\" (again in the\nright-hand frame), and create a snippet named \"schema-blog\", and\npaste your schema array there.\n<\/p><p>\nThen you need to configure your newsticker to use the new schema. Here\nyou have two options, either set it to be used by all \"newsticker\"\nfolders on your site, or only your blog.\n<\/p><p>\nTo use it for all newstickers, create another snippet named \"config\" in the \/sitegroup-config\/de.linkm.newsticker directory, and in that snippet\nplace the following:\n<\/p><pre>\"schemadb\" =&gt; \"\/sitegroup-config\/de.linkm.newsticker\/schema-blog\",<\/pre><p>\nIf you want to enable it for only one newsticker folder (or override\nthe default specified above), you can do this by going to the newsticker\nfolder on site, and clicking the \"Component configuration\" toolbar\nitem. Scroll down the form, and enter your schema's path in the\n\"Path to the schema database\" field:\n<\/p><pre>\/sitegroup-config\/de.linkm.newsticker\/schema-blog<\/pre><p>\nNow your blog should have categories enabled. I'm not sure how\nEcto handles them, but probably the next time you refresh your posting\nlist there, the category selections should appear to the editor. At\nleast that is how it works in MarsEdit. The categories will also appear\nin the RSS feed generated from your blog. But they won't yet appear\non your site. For that you need to modify the output templates of\nyour blog, and that is the subject of another lesson :-)\n<\/p><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> the steps needed for adding simple category support to your\nblog might sounds exceedingly difficult.

Several blog systems utilize <a href=\n    \"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/REC-html40\/struct\/links.html#h-12.1.2\">tags<\/a>\n    for <a href=\n    \"http:\/\/usefulinc.com\/edd\/blog\/contents\/2003\/07\/22-rssautodetect\/read\">\n    RSS autodetection<\/a>. For example, the Firefox browser looks\n    for this tag and <a href=\n    \"http:\/\/blog.codefront.net\/archives\/2004\/07\/13\/rss-feed-integration-in-firefox\">\n    enables feed subscription<\/a> if it has been detected.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    In similar vein, I would like to propose usage of tags for\n    making PermaLinks machine-readable. Here's what I added to\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a>\n    today:\n<\/p>\n<pre>\n&lt;link rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"&lt;PermaLink URL&gt;\" \/&gt;\n<\/pre>\n<p>\n    When embedded into the HTML block this way, it is already\n    recognized by Mozilla and displayed in the \"Page Info\" window:\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img width=\"450\" height=\"151\" border=\"0\" title=\n    \"PermaLink address shown in Mozilla Firefox\" alt=\n    \"mozilla-autodetect.jpg\" src=\n    \"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-b062bc1e44487af697679df27c147c9c\/mozilla-autodetect.jpg\" \/>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Preferably different authoring and content management tools\n    would become aware of this tag and start looking for it. When\n    the user would insert a link to a document, the authoring tool\n    could make a HTTP GET request to the URL, and if the PermaLink\n    could be found from there link to it instead. That way\n    permanent linking would be completely transparent to website\n    authors.\n    <br \/>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Updated 2005-10-06:<\/span>\n    Switched from <span style=\n    \"font-style: italic;\">rel=\"PermaLink\"<\/span> to <span style=\n    \"font-style: italic;\">rel=\"bookmark\"<\/span>, as suggested by\n    the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microformats.org\/\">Microformats<\/a>\n    folks.\n    <br \/>\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/multilingual-midcom-sites\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Multilingual MidCOM sites","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-02-04 15:39:51","atom:content":"<p>\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Finland\">Finland<\/a> is a\n    country with three official languages, and many organizations\n    here want to provide their websites in multilingual format.\n    While <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a>\n    supports storing <a href=\n    \"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-067c767dd66067bb65d6a0f0a88943a8\">\n    multilingual content<\/a> in same content tree, this is still\n    not widely used. A far more common strategy is to use\n    <em>language prefix URLs<\/em>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    With language prefixes each translation of a site has its own\n    content tree starting from the language name, or <a href=\n    \"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/ER\/IG\/ert\/iso639.htm\">2-letter code<\/a>.\n    This has the advantage of allowing slightly different content\n    structure to be presented on different translations. For\n    example, a company might want to present products differently\n    to the domestic and international markets. It also makes it\n    easy to tell what language the content behind a link is in.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    To make a <a href=\n    \"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-85e86ba5433b5566da29fe9b32e2a425\">\n    MidCOM<\/a> site multilingual there are two steps.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    <strong>First<\/strong>, <a href=\n    \"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-992517d7d09087ed7714086dcd35be0b\">\n    set up the website<\/a> normally. Then log into the <abbr title=\n    \"Authoring Interface System\">AIS<\/abbr> interface and create\n    top-level topics for each language you want to have on your\n    site. It doesn't matter what component is used to drive those\n    topics, but very often it is <em>de.linkm.taviewer<\/em>. The\n    URL name of the topics should be the two letter country code.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    The top-level country topics are actually the front pages of\n    different language versions of the site. The site structure can\n    be created freely under them, although it would be recommended\n    to make the site structure quite identical between languages.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Then<\/strong> you have to make MidCOM aware of the\n    language topics.

Prior to that the project will make a first release of the 4Mb Java-based DBE Servent in April 2005. The participants are planning to move the project to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sourceforge.net\/\">SourceForge<\/a> after this first release.\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>OpenPSA possibilities<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nWith <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPSA<\/a>, the case for using DBE would be quite clear. We've already <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/managing_nanocorporations_with_openpsa.html\">been thinking<\/a> of implementing Web Services to make it easier for networked companies to work with each other more easily, and what DBE would add on top of those would include caching and asynchronous RPC support. In practice this would be we would only need to define the APIs used for the different services in OpenPSA, and then pass those to DBE. The Servent would then handle the actual connections between the different installations and dealing with nodes that are offline.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis way OpenPSA would enable organizations to manage all their operations with parners and subcontractors using DBE-compatible applications transparently. DBE-enabled OpenPSA would look approximately the following:\n<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-41c586b1dca66e94dd6fdc46e80b6217\/dbe-openpsa-simple.png\" border=\"0\" height=\"515\" width=\"417\" alt=\"dbe-openpsa-simple.png\" title=\"Possible OpenPSA Projects usage with DBE\" \/>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSupporting the Service Oriented Architecture would be a major change in OpenPSA code. We would have to encapsulate all data handling parts of the system with classes that would be able to store and fetch information using both local <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> storage and remote Web Service APIs.\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>DBE risks<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nWhile the DBE concept sounds promising, it is still an unreleased piece of software. Additionally, it has not been tested outside academic circles, so the promises of scalability and automatic networking might not materialize in the real world.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAnother problem is standardization of the Web Service interfaces used for different business scenarios or transactions. It has traditionally been a big problem to get an industry to work together on developing standard vocabularies and APIs, and DBE doesn't really address that. As the developers say, it is only the <em>\"TCP for business applications\"<\/em>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis might or might not be a problem. We could easily define a set of APIs using the taxonomies familiar in OpenPSA, and the rest of the industry could just follow us. This is what has pretty much happened with the different ad-hoc standards defined by the blogging world. However, it would require that our API would be generic enough, and that the developers of different project applications would find it easily. This all would hinge on the popularity of the DBE platform.\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>Project possibilities<\/h2>\n\n<p>\nThe risks and non-existing user base of DBE are somewhat alleviated by EU funding for first companies developing services for the platform. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/\">We<\/a> haven't yet made any decisions but we'll definitely think about utilizing DBE. OpenPSA needs some kind of Web Services interface to support networked business, and despite risks this would be a quite appealing solution.\n<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/first-flying-lesson\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"First flying lesson","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-02-27 13:50:04","atom:content":"<p>\nI had my first flying lesson yesterday.

But when it started to seem like the amount of students would make for some capacity issues with MIK I accepted an offer from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kolumbus.fi\/bf-lento\/\">BF-lento<\/a>, a private flight school. This enabled me to start flying already now, instead of waiting until I finish the ground exam.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe first flight was quite simple. We took off from EFHF, and the instructor flew us out of the DEGER reporting point, and gave the control to me. I then flew around for 20 minutes off the shore of Porvoo before taking us back to DEGER. I was surprised how small movements were needed for controlling the plane, and of how easy it was to follow the airspace with the radio. The plane felt easier to keep going in right directions than the simulator.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe snow sparkled in the late February sunshine, and the world looked really nice. While the flight was short it made me very enthusiastic about the training, and about hopefully attaining the pilot's license in the future.\n<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/design-new-midcom-ui---win-an-ipod-mini\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Design new MidCOM UI - Win an iPod Mini","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-02-28 21:54:35","atom:content":"<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">Nemein<\/a> is sponsoring a contest to design a new user interface to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> Open Source Content Management System.

The main issues were:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>\"repligard\" binary was missing in the repligard debian package (fixed now in 1.6.3-1)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Datagard didn't change the host names of Aegir, Midgard welcome page etc. to the name of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/vhost.html\">virtualhost<\/a> we created<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>MidgardPageCache didn't work at all, causing 404s. This was caused by having both Apache2 and Apache1 Midgard modules installed simultaneously. The DEBs should prevent this from happening<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>1 and 3 were clearly packaging problems, and 2 was a datagard bug. Having seen Jarkko's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/distros\/fedora.html\">Fedora packages<\/a>, I know the Midgard binaries\ncan be made to work \"out of the box\". Now we just need to push\nthe DEBs into the same standards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides the host naming bug, the questions in Datagard appeared quite\nconfusing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some ideas regarding that:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Datagard could start with a \"simple mode\" where the system would\nsimply set up the database as \"midgard\" on localhost. Then there\nwould be an option for switching to \"expert mode\" where different\nDB hosts and DB names would be possible<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Datagard could also query whether the user can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/database.html\">manage databases<\/a>\nwithout supplying a password. On some distros root can do that\nwith MySQL, and in those cases asking the MySQL root username\/password\nshouldn't be necessary<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The wording of the different questions in Datagard should be fixed\nto be more explanatory. Here are two mockups done by Tigert:<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Installation mode selection:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[x] Easy installation - your Apache and\n     MySQL run on the same computer and\n     you just want to get things up and\n     running with good default settings.\n     Recommended for most users.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>[ ] Custom installation - For people\n      familiar with Midgard. This lets\n     you customize the installation\n     parameters. Also you need to choose\n     this if your database is on a\n     separate server host.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>[ Cancel ] [ Continue > ]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Midgard DB host selection:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Midgard Database Host<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Midgard needs a MySQL database to work.\n      This can  be either  on the  same server\n      host as Midgard itself,  or it  could be\n      a separate computer.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>If you have  both on the  same computer,\n      you  can just  leave  the  field  empty,\n      otherwise  enter  the  hostname  or  IP\n      address  of your MySQL database server.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Database host: [________________________]<\/p>\n  \n  <p>[ Cancel ] [ Continue > ]<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Another big point would be clarifying the different usernames and passwords used with Midgard. There are three separate:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>MySQL root account used for creating the databases<\/li>\n<li>Midgard's MySQL account used by Midgard-Apache and Repligard when connecting to \nthe database<\/li>\n<li>Midgard's administrator account used for logging into Aegir and SpiderAdmin<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Both better wording and some automation could help with all of these three. Datagard can probe whether MySQL root password is needed, the Midgard MySQL account can default to \"midgard\" and a generated password, and the administrator account is by default admin\/password.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know Jarkko has been reordering datagard lately, so we could possibly fit these improvements into that work?<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/going-to-ntc\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Going to NTC","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-03-22 23:51:17","atom:content":"<p>I'm traveling to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nten.org\/ntc\">Nonprofit Technology Conference<\/a> in Chicago, USA tomorrow to present <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a> in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nten.org\/ntc-2005-opensource\">Open Source Content Management<\/a> \"<a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.advocacydev.org\/cgi-bin\/wiki.pl?SpeedGeeking\">SpeedGeeking<\/a>\" session.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to meeting fellow <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tacticaltech.org\/summersource\">Summer Sourcers<\/a> and other interesting NGO people in the event...<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/first-day-of-nonprofit-technology-conference\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"First day of Nonprofit Technology Conference","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-03-24 16:51:19","atom:content":"<p>The first day of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nten.org\/ntc\">Nonprofit Technology Conference 2005<\/a> started with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nten.org\/ntc-2005-trott\">breakfast session<\/a> where <a href=\"http:\/\/mena.typepad.com\/\">Mena Trott<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sixapart.com\/\">Six Apart<\/a> was telling about community building with blogging tools. Her examples included <a href=\"http:\/\/www.savekaryn.com\/\">Save Karyn<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screamingpickle.com\/members\/StarWarsKid\/\">Star Wars Kid<\/a> raising money through popularity in the weblog world.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-31a230f04a901c1745ca30e7b177e0bc\/jacob-breakfast-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob asking a question\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The main idea with weblogs is to capture the <em>personal voice<\/em> of the author, and to make publishing that as easy as possible. Most blogging tools are either <a href=\"http:\/\/www.typepad.com\/\">inexpensive<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">Open Source<\/a>, and allow easy publication of media rich content. Another important point is that all blogs share some common user interface elements like archives, RSS feeds, comments and posts arranged by date. This makes it easier for readers to use and follow the site. The presentation ended with a demo how <em>Ryan Jacobs<\/em> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ungana-afrika.org\/\">Ungana-Afrika<\/a> (yes, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/news\/press\/2004-02-11-000.html\">familiar organization<\/a>) created a blog for himself in couple minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The TypePad <a href=\"http:\/\/help.typepad.com\/weblogs\/intro.html#creating_a_new_weblog\">blog creation UI<\/a> is quite similar in concept to the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/site_creation_wizard_runs.html\">Midgard Site Wizard<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You create an user account (in Midgard, an organization)<\/li>\n<li>You give a name to the website<\/li>\n<li>You select a layout from set of templates provided<\/li>\n<li>You select whether the blog is public or password protected<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>...and that's it, then you're online and ready to publish. Now the challenge for the Midgard Community is to <a href=\"http:\/\/permalink.gmane.org\/gmane.comp.web.midgard.devel\/5228\">ensure<\/a> that this all happens out-of-the-box with the upcoming 1.7 release.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another interesting point regarding blogging would be the usage of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moblog\">moblogs<\/a> to report the field work of NGOs. For example, my roommate <em>Jacob Patton<\/em> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freetheslaves.net\/home.php\">Free The Slaves<\/a> saw this as an interesting opportunity for reporting in real time how freed slaves and human trafficking victims are being rehabilitated.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Data security<\/h2>\n\n<p>The next session of the day was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nten.org\/ntc-2005-datasec\">Data Security in High Risk Organizations<\/a> held by fellow Midgardian, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.privaterra.org\/blog-rg\/\">Robert Guerra<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.privaterra.org\/\">Privaterra<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.net.ohio-state.edu\/security\/bios\/matt-kestian.shtml\">Matt Kestian<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/\">Microsoft<\/a>. An important point made in the presentation is that security is not only computer security, but also physical security.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-ddbd3f5ad3f5d15b1071859677bcda39\/rguerra-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Robert's presentation\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Defense in Depth<\/em> is the concept of building several layers of security. For example, one layer is the perimeter of an internal network, then comes the security of actual applications, and then things like backups and disaster security. However, data security is still just one layer. For example, one network security company I've visited had a very strongly firewalled working environment where online access would've been difficult. However, backup tapes containing all the confidential data were just lying on shelves in corridor near the office lobby. It would've been childishly easy to walk in, grab a tape, and then examine it in good time.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to know what devices and services run in the network of a company, and to periodically check that they're present, working and not tampered with. It is also important to scan the network to see that nothing unknown has popped in there. The question to ask about each asset is \"<em>Is this a device I can trust?<\/em>\"<\/p>\n\n<p>All devices should be examined to ensure they have all required protection like automated security patches, antivirus software, host-based firewalls and that they run only services that are really needed. It is also a good idea to keep in mind that it is usually possible to switch insecure or troublesome applications to more secure ones, like switching from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/ie\/default.mspx\">Internet Explorer<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/products\/firefox\/\">Firefox<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Email communications can be secured easily by running the email protocols encrypted by SSL. Most email applications support encryption in their preferences. While this secures the communication between the email application and the server from password sniffers, it doesn't actually protect email transmitted between organizations. Solution to that is to encrypt the actual emails using tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imc.org\/smime-pgpmime.html\">S\/MIME<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnupg.org\/\">GPG<\/a>. For human rights groups there is also a special-purpose email-like bulletin system named <a href=\"http:\/\/www.martus.org\/\">Martus<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>After lunch<\/h2>\n\n<p>After lunch I helped Robert to set up SSL encryption for his Midgard sites running on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ubuntulinux.org\/\">Ubuntu<\/a>. I also briefly met <a href=\"http:\/\/benramsey.com\/\">Ben Ramsey<\/a> who <a href=\"http:\/\/benramsey.com\/2005\/03\/24\/name-dropping-at-the-ntc\/\">criticized us<\/a> of making Midgard too hard to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/\">install<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the evening we went to a dinner with some people from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engenderhealth.org\/\">EngenderHealth<\/a> to discuss possibilities of using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPSA<\/a> for project portfolio management in NGOs. Apparently this would require a higher-level tracking of targets and initiatives in a Balanced Scorecard-like fashion. However, as my fortune cookie reminded, \"<em>Too much confidence has deceived many a one.<\/em>\"<\/p>\n\n<p>After the lunch the evening ended in the Microsoft party in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hob.com\/venues\/clubvenues\/chicago\/\">House of Blues<\/a>.

After that we had the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nten.org\/ntc-2005-opensource\">Online Publishing and Content Management with Open Source Software<\/a> session chaired by <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.advocacydev.org\/cgi-bin\/wiki.pl?RyanOzimek\">Ryan Ozimek<\/a>. Ryan and <em>Usha Venkatachallam<\/em> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beaconfire.com\/\">Beaconfire<\/a> opened the talk by introducing the audience to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/\">Open Source Content Management<\/a> in general and then we had the <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.advocacydev.org\/cgi-bin\/wiki.pl?SpeedGeeking\">SpeedGeeking<\/a> introductions of the <a href=\"http:\/\/nten.editme.com\/OpenSourceCMS\">different CMSs present<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-95acb9335f997393549fe5268820210c\/usha-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Usha's CMS presentation\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the Matrix?<\/h2>\n\n<p>What surprised me was that Usha and Ryan recommended the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensourcecms.com\/\">OpenSourceCMS.com<\/a> service as a definitive resource on Open Source Content Management. In reality that service showcases only a very narrow selection of CMS tools, all of which are low-end PHP and MySQL systems. The service also more or less feels like just an advertisement for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opensourcehost.com\/mambo\/\">OpenSourceHost<\/a>, the company hosting some of those systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>It should always be remembered that Open Source CMS is much more than just the lightweight tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.postnuke.com\/index.php?module=Navigation\">PostNuke<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.drupal.org\/\">Drupal<\/a>. A service like OpenSourceCMS.com misses all of the major systems like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zope.org\/\">Zope<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/lenya.apache.org\/\">Lenya<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opencms.org\/opencms\/en\/\">OpenCMS<\/a>. When I refuted Usha's point on OpenSourceCMS.com being a definitive resource we ended up in argument about what then would be the recommendable resource. Unfortunately the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/matrix\/index.html\">OSCOM CMS Matrix<\/a> is in really bad shape, so only service we came up with is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmsmatrix.org\/\">CMS Matrix<\/a>. It would be good if <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/\">OSCOM<\/a> could rise up to provide a better comparison service.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Midgard Points<\/h2>\n\n<p>The SpeedGeeking model meant giving a short 5 minute \"elevator speech\" presentation about the system to circling groups. As the time was short, we had to keep to the point. I decided to focus on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nehmer.net\/~bergie\/ntc-2005\/\">points that differentiate<\/a> Midgard from the other systems, an approach familiar to my <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/comparing_midgard_and_wordpress.html\">earlier blog posts<\/a>. The main ones were:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Midgard uses PHP for scripting but provides its own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/framework\/\">Application Server<\/a> that is provided as an Apache module<\/li>\n<li>The application server enables us to do cool things like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/authentication.html\">NTLM single sign-on<\/a> with Windows networks<\/li>\n<li>Midgard's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts\/repligard\/\">replication system<\/a> enables offline usage in low-connectivity environments like Africa, and supports real staging\/live setups with multiple servers<\/li>\n<li>Besides PHP, Midgard also has native <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/jukka_back_from_hiatus__jcr_for_midgard.html\">Java<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/midgard.tigris.org\/source\/browse\/midgard\/src\/apis\/ruby\/\">Ruby<\/a> support<\/li>\n<li>The \"Edit this page\" model reduces overhead with publishing content<\/li>\n<li>All modifications in Midgard are stored in RCS version control repository<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>I also introduced the group to the <a href=\"http:\/\/snip.yukatan.fi\/space\/start\/2005-02-21\/1#CMS_migration_with_the_Exorcist\">Exorcist<\/a> concept of migrating content between different CMSs using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jcp.org\/en\/jsr\/detail?id=170\">Java Content Repository<\/a> standard.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Open Source Project Management<\/h2>\n\n<p>The CMS discussion continued over lunch, and I was invited to speak in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nten.org\/ntc-2005-together\">How to make a successful open source project<\/a> panel in place of <em>Karl Fogel<\/em> of <a href=\"http:\/\/subversion.tigris.org\/\">Subversion<\/a> fame who had had to cancel.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-018d27a26b35193d051f956c9983c771\/opensource-panel-people-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"People in the panel\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The challenges of building an Open Source community include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping the project goal clear<\/li>\n<li>Providing support and documentation<\/li>\n<li>Making the software installable<\/li>\n<li>Predictability, providing a believable roadmap and release schedule<\/li>\n<li>Ensuring that the application or component is attractive to developers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The question of roles is also important. In a balanced project there would be not only developers, but also project managers and usability experts. However, that rarely happens in a for-free Open Source projects. Developers ready to work on pro bono basis usually want to be free from the constraints of typical commercial development projects. The easiest way to ensure the availability of also non-coding resources in an Open Source project is to pay for them. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openusability.org\/\">OpenUsability<\/a> project tries to bring usability expertise into Open Source projects, but its impact will remain to be seen.<\/p>\n\n<p>All Open Source projects need a selection of tools. There should at least be a bug tracker, version control system and a mailing list. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wiki\">Wikis<\/a> can be very useful for developer conversations and user documentation. In several projects <a href=\"http:\/\/www.planetplanet.org\/\">Planet-aggregated<\/a> weblogs and instant messaging are beginning to override mailing list as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inittab.de\/blog\/2005\/02\/13#20050213_how-do-os-projects-communicate\">communication medium<\/a>. Project management tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.basecamphq.com\/\">BaseCamp<\/a> could also be useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>To get the project really rolling:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Invest into making a working version 1.0, then recruit volunteers<\/li>\n<li>Get people who know the community the project is for<\/li>\n<li>Built usability into the development process<\/li>\n<li>Enable users and beta testers to get feedback directly to the developers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The question of documentation and \"final polish\" has traditionally been difficult for Open Source projects.

JCR has been originally developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.day.com\/en.html\">Day Software<\/a> in Switzerland as a generic content management API, the \"<a href=\"http:\/\/snip.yukatan.fi\/space\/start\/2005-02-04\/1#The_JDBC_of_Content_Management_Systems\">JDBC of Content Management Systems<\/a>\".<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-e0ee8464df39ef1385818f94753a07f1\/MgdSchema_Workshop_Sitebuilders.jpg\" alt=\"Site building tutorial\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>JSR-170, the Java Content Repository<\/h3>\n\n<p>With JCR, the content repository is divided into <em>workspaces<\/em> that in Midgard are represented by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-f624e440f76a466d5870374bca8e1449\">Sitegroups<\/a>. JCR spec also defines a method for copying content between workspaces that is not yet implemented in <a href=\"http:\/\/midgard.tigris.org\/source\/browse\/midgard\/src\/apis\/java\/\">midgard-java<\/a>. However, this could be interesting future way to implement <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ngogeeks.com\/node\/136\">staging-live<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Within the workspace the content is managed as a tree. With Midgard, there is a virtual root node, and under that are the content roots like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-f47e4764bfcd5f897bd6af53ea51a75f\">topic<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-2732f47bbdf5a868fd7811d696886149\">style<\/a> trees. Non-hierarchical structures are stored as <em>references<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>JCR provides an API for traversing the content hierarchy, and making modifications to different properties. The modifications can be collected into a set of atom operations that can be saved together. JCR would also provide real transactions, but these are not yet supported by Midgard.<\/p>\n\n<p>Midgard JCR support also supports <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/xpath\/xpath_intro.asp\">XPath<\/a> queries and XML import\/export we already utilize in the <a href=\"http:\/\/snip.yukatan.fi\/space\/start\/2005-02-21\/1#CMS_migration_with_the_Exorcist\">Exorcist<\/a> cross-CMS content migration tool. JCR also has an introspection system that can be used by clients for creating custom administrative interfaces that automatically support all new content types in the repository.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the JCR Server system, the Midgard repository is also available through <a href=\"http:\/\/jcr.yukatan.fi\/rmi\/\">RMI<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/mail-archives.eu.apache.org\/mod_mbox\/incubator-jackrabbit-dev\/200410.mbox\/%3ceb7e219041026064862d367b8@mail.gmail.com%3e\">WebDAV<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-1a63fb388c0cb7daae3eaee99b182e7a\/MgdSchema_Workshop_Sightseeing_Flight.jpg\" alt=\"Preparing for the sightseeing flight\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The big question with JCR is whether the standard will be adopted by different CMS developers.

The Java Native Interface would then be compiled by default, and server administrator could simply enable JCR by installing a Java Virtual Machine.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another consumer for a JVM in Midgard is the <a href=\"http:\/\/lucene.apache.org\/java\/docs\/index.html\">Lucene-based<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-permalink-fcd64afd3d4a119759535c28bbef364c\">indexing system<\/a> in MidCOM, and the installation locations and dependencies should be synchronized between the two.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jukka will try to produce an installation HOWTO for setting up <em>midgard-java<\/em> together with the JCR Server next week.<\/p>\n\n<h3>MidCOM indexing with Lucene<\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-85e86ba5433b5566da29fe9b32e2a425\">MidCOM<\/a> uses a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nathan-syntronics.de\/midcom-permalink-68666d1ae755a05479a50b83ae89aef4\">Lucene-based indexer<\/a> for providing a full-text search system that provides a \"live\" index into the site data. All MidCOM components notify the indexer every time they change the data, meaning that all searches made in the system will return current content.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the search system, users can easily query either text from anywhere in the Midgard content structure, or using <a href=\"http:\/\/lucene.apache.org\/java\/docs\/queryparsersyntax.html\">advanced syntax<\/a> for searching based on specific content fields or value ranges.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-dbe6e46a5f6c31f2604a0f3c0fcb41a0\/MgdSchema_Workshop_After_Sauna.jpg\" alt=\"Discussion after sauna\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Documents are organized within the MidCOM index based on their <em>resource identifier<\/em>, which is typically the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-ad4daed9d56f1ca0049b7ce116efc197\">object GUID<\/a>. The fields are indexed separately, but they are also combined into the <em>content<\/em> field for the regular full-text search of all data. For native MidCOM content, the <em>topic<\/em> field is also stored into the index. External indexed data like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPSA content<\/a> should not utilize that field.<\/p>\n\n<p>The index also contains metadata like creation, revision and indexing timestamps.

The suggested directory for the index is <em>$MIDGARD_PREFIX\/share\/midgard\/indexer\/$INDEX_NAME<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The index can be accessed in two different ways. The <em>midcom.helper.search<\/em> component provides a normal site search engine with both a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/search\/\">simple interface<\/a> and an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/search\/advanced.html\">advanced search<\/a> with support for limiting the search based on content types, topic trees and modification dates.

As most of the days it has been snowing heavily, this hasn't been much of a problem. However, I thought it would be time to do something.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hdcenter.fi\/\">bike dealership<\/a> didn't seem much concerned about the problem, I came up with another idea. My friend Jose bought a nice fifties-style <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/bikes\/enfield-bullet.html\">Royal Enfield<\/a> motorcycle from his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/journal\/jose-to-east-and-back-again\/india---the-last-crusade.html\">Indian adventure<\/a> last spring, but unfortunately <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/updates\/2004-04-13-000.html\">broke his leg<\/a> shortly afterwards and so the bike was built into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/updates\/2004-06-30-000.html\">running state<\/a> but never registered.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-b25f1a22c2821eaf351190f6ba8c9646\/Joses_Enfield_at_EFHF.jpg\" alt=\"Jose's Enfield at the Malmi aerodrome\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Yesterday afternoon I then went to Rambo's garage, and <a href=\"\/moblog\/2005-04-22-1114161905.html\">started<\/a> the engine without any problems. The Engine ran fine while I rode it to an inspection station near to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pelastamalmi.org\/en\/index.html\">Helsinki-Malmi airport<\/a>, and yet again fine when riding to another inspection station after a flying lesson.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the inspectors had very little sympathy for the machine. They said it wouldn't pass into Finnish registry because its chassis lacked some EU stamps, even though similar bikes are being <a href=\"http:\/\/www.motoitalia.fi\/\">sold constantly<\/a> by the Enfield Finnish importer. No final conclusions were reached, though, as some members of <a href=\"http:\/\/enfield.ewok.fi\/\">Bullets MCC<\/a>, the Finnish Royal Enfield Club claimed to have the required certificates acquired from the Indian factory.<\/p>\n\n<p>A bit taken back but not yet accepting defeat, I started the bike at the station. It started on the first kick, but when I took it off the centre stand, it stopped. The fifties look of the bike quickly gathered several helpers, but the bike refused to start in the half hour we spent playing with it. After a while we figure out that the batter was empty, and that in turn had fouled the spark plug. Changing the plug we were able to get the bike running in a way, and return to the airport.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-0ee74fd8c697c8e7abdda841be7dae36\/An-2_Adding_Oil.jpg\" alt=\"Adding oil to the Antonov\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>At the airport cafeteria we sat down with Erkki, the pilot of the huge Soviet forties <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/An-2\">An-2 biplane freighter<\/a> owner by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lennuklubi.org\/index_en.htm\">Lennuklubi<\/a>. He had helped me back at the inspection station together with Matti from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netsonic.fi\/~hhra\/\">HHRA<\/a>, and as my second flying lesson of the day got cancelled because of hail, we took a look at the Antonov.<\/p>\n\n<p>A fire extinguisher pipe in the plane had to be replaced, and after that and the other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lennuklubi.org\/video\/download.php?file=Antonov_45MB.mpg\">startup rituals<\/a>, we went for a short spin together with two Russian mechanics. As the Antonov is very expensive to operate, we only flew a very short route, but even with that I was amazed at the stability of the big plane, and even got to take a short turn at the controls.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-4882e08cfb0200fddd7a30827568b034\/An-2_Bergie_in_controls.jpg\" alt=\"Bergie in An-2 cockpit\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>After the flight we cleaned up the plane from the liters of oil that the engine had spewed out, and I returned to try again starting the Enfield. Unfortunately it again had issues with getting the ammeter to the positive side, and when it finally started, it happened with a loud bang that shot the airbox cover open and the headlight off. With this setup I limped the bike to the nearest gas station, drained the gas tank and cleaned the carburetor.<\/p>\n\n<p>With new gas in tank the bike finally ran acceptably, as long as I kept the electricity usage as down as possible. For example, if I wanted to use both braking light and turn indicators at the same time, I had to rev up the engine or it would die. But even then, I got the bike home without incident.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-271e5509542d6585e00b87b620ff786c\/Joses_Enfield_at_EFHF_2.jpg\" alt=\"Jose's Enfield after the loud bang\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Now the battery is charging, and I hope that this will cure the ignition problems.

Alexander was very happy to hear about the new <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-permalink-0ca727a1a16a493d5e8b62a509b28c46\">Midgard 2 developments<\/a>, and maybe a bit smug about the stuff he proposed three years ago finally becoming a reality.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-1a60366840b26a2c0e49a31877d0f81b\/OSF_Alexander_IBM_Booth.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Bokovoy at the IBM booth\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The recent advances in Midgard got us talking about the long-term vision, and obviously Alexander had a bunch of ideas:<\/p>\n\n<p>Alexander's view of computing includes most processing moving to be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gridcomputingplanet.com\/news\/article.php\/3304571\">grid-handled web services<\/a>. The Open Source infrastructure for building grid-able services already exists in the form of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www-unix.globus.org\/toolkit\/\">Globus toolkit<\/a>. Globus enables web services to be built in C or Java, and supports things like Kerberos authentication between the grid scheduler and the service providers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another idea was to enable Midgard to use the new <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Git\">Git<\/a> version control system as a distributed storage system. Currently Git is available only as a set of command-line tools but once the format stabilizes, a <em>libgit<\/em> could make this kind of work easy. Git repositories would know from which system each modification was coming from, and make Notes-like multi-direction replication possible. LWN has <a href=\"http:\/\/lwn.net\/Articles\/131657\/\">more information<\/a> about Git.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also talked about the problems of making Midgard bindings into different languages due to the inability to remove classes that have been declared once during runtime, and messy C APIs. Alexander had the idea of implementing the Midgard 2 API natively only for PHP and Java, and handling other languages through Web Services passed either remotely or via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/Software\/dbus\">D-BUS<\/a>. There are already D-BUS bindings to both Python and .Net (Mono), which would make creating Midgard bindings for them relatively easy.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Free Software and economy<\/h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-587e01dae83618a019fb87ef4bf07809\/OSF_Celeb_Panel.jpg\" alt=\"Press Conference\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Maddog's keynote dealt with how local economies benefit from Open Source. The basic nature of Free Software is that it enables local service companies and software developers to easily create IT solutions without expensive licensing costs. Currently Brazil funnels a billion dollars every year out of their economy in software license fees. With Open Source, this money could be kept in the local circulation, and the solutions could be created by the local experts.<\/p>\n\n<p>Free software also enables software users to localize the software for their own language, character set and cultural environment. In the proprietary world, American companies have very little incentive to translate their tools to Icelandic or some of the hundreds of Indian languages, but with Open Source this is happening constantly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Open Source also means better security and longevity of solutions. Companies go out of business and change their product lines, but Free Software stays in running order as long as somebody still has interest in it.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Other projects<\/h2>\n\n<p>Other interesting talks included Michael Sparks' talk about how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/rd\/index.shtml\">BBC Research &amp; Development<\/a> is developing Open Source video and audio streaming tools like the <a href=\"http:\/\/dirac.sourceforge.net\/\">Dirac<\/a> video codec. They have archive of hundreds of thousands of hours of footage, and moving that to a digital format and making publicly available might provide a really interesting service. Their <a href=\"http:\/\/kamaelia.sourceforge.net\/\">Kamaelia<\/a> tools are currently built in Python using the Unix toolkit methodology where different pieces of the system can be changed easily.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-6cc64142deeb8818bd61714b1106162b\/OSF_Penguins.jpg\" alt=\"Penguins on the walk\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zope.com\/Corporate\/Management\/Page.html\">Rob Page<\/a> was presenting the product strategies of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zope.com\/\">Zope Corporation<\/a>. His presentation used the old Gartner OS CMS report as a source on market positioning, and mentioned that in the last year the number of Zope deployments have doubled to about 58k, probably due to <a href=\"http:\/\/plone.org\/\">Plone<\/a>. Zope Corp itself is not an Open Source company. Instead, their products are distributed following a <em>visible source<\/em> model where end customers get the source code but are not allowed to redistribute it. Most of Zope Corp's revenue is generated through hosting (40%) and product licenses (30%).<\/p>\n\n<p>The professional services of Zope Corporation are fairly similar to the ones <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">Nemein<\/a> provides for the Midgard platform: Support with possibility of Service Level Agreement, feature development including projects split between multiple clients, localized documentation, and so on.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Community building<\/h2>\n\n<p>Larry Wall's very funny talk, <em>Building Open Source Communities<\/em> dealt with building a thriving ecosystem for a Free Software project. Building a successful community is much more difficult than making a successful engineering product, and few developers are really familiar how the communities really work.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-4221cf782eecf08644f9e07c85d4b56c\/OSF_Crowd.jpg\" alt=\"Audience during a HP presentation\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>One major question is about the personalities involved, <em>who<\/em> will be interested in the project, who will be excluded, etc? The <em>what<\/em> questions included the goal of the community, and what the contributors will get out of it. In the <em>where<\/em> space, the questions deal on locations and services needed for running the community. <em>When<\/em> is a question of project maturity, and of when to allow community to form. Also, when the different project services should be opened, and when, if ever, the project should be terminated. <em>Why<\/em> is also relevant. Why should contributors join up, and also, why to release the project as Open Source.<\/p>\n\n<p>The structure of the community should not be made too complex, or too designed before the actual community forms. People are all individuals, and as they succeed and fail, enter and leave, the community should be still able to function.<\/p>\n\n<p>In general, communities succeed if they have a good habitat, plentiful food, they're healthy, and practice plentiful cross-fertilization. Similarly, they die if one of these aspects fails. \"<em>A community needs to share a set of core values, but also allow honest differences of opinion on side issues<\/em>.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-8a58c8ab1a7be14b566c7c7e1d50b239\/OSF_Georgian_Dinner.jpg\" alt=\"After the dinner on Old Arbat\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>On thursday evening we had a very nice dinner with most of the speakers in a Georgian restaurant on the Old Arbat street.

For that, we'd need an easy way to input coordinates together with the data.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/drbacchus.com\/wordpress\/?p=950\">Rich Bowen writes<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I was talking about Geocaching, as well as other applications of GPS technology, including integration with blogging. Henri is talking with the <a href=\"http:\/\/geourl.org\/\">GeoURL<\/a> people about creating standards for encoding coordinate information in other data. For example, there are apparently cameras now that will encode the coordinates into the image, in the meta-data headers. So then, imagine if you could have a search engine where you could search for all photos taken within 1 mile of a certain location, between certain dates. Or, if people have location information in the blog entries, you could search for blog entries about a particular location on a particular day, and build a composite picture of a particular event from multiple individuals. I think it&rsquo;s an idea with a ton of potential, if there was an easy way for people to obtain location information. It&rsquo;s a bit painful right now, and even someone as fascinated with the idea as myself tends not to go through the pain every time.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Besides the question of obtaining accurate coordinate information, and how to easily input it to the system, another big question is privacy. Content creators should be able to state what level of accuracy they're comfortable with:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Full coordinates<\/li>\n<li>Coordinates with last few digits removed<\/li>\n<li>City information<\/li>\n<li>Country information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This level of privacy could also be connected to time. For example, I might be uncomfortable about announcing my location in real-time, but would have no problems in revealing the coordinates after a week or two.<\/p>\n\n<p>I need to think about this a bit and try to hack a proof of concept using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-c25d278a232a61cc6218d726215916e4\">MidCOM metadata system<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If content is revealed only on city level, it could be converted back to coordinates using the open source <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxmind.com\/download\/worldcities\/\">cities of the world<\/a> database. <a href=\"http:\/\/geotags.com\/geo\/geotags2.html\">Geo Tags<\/a> seem to have all the actual HTML meta tags we'd need for these different levels:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;meta name=\"geo.position\" content=\"49.2;-123.4\" \/&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"geo.placename\" content=\"London, Ontario\" \/&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"geo.region\" content=\"CA-ON\" \/&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>This would probably work better in this concept than the GeoURL-style <a href=\"http:\/\/geourl.org\/add.html\">ICBM<\/a> tag that is limited to only coordinate information.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/first-solo-flight\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"First Solo Flight","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-05-06 10:31:41","atom:content":"<p>I flew my first solo flight today as part of <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-permalink-47aef43e58a8ae539123890db5a116af\">PPL(A) pilot training<\/a>.

MidCOM requires very different and much stricter development style than \"pure Midgard\" applications have used to follow. However, the <a href=\"http:\/\/comments.gmane.org\/gmane.comp.web.midgard.devel\/5429\">advantages<\/a> are substantial:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>MidCOM provides standardized services like authentication, localization, debugger, templating, caching and configurable object editors (via datamanager)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>MidCOM's filesystem oriented approach for code makes version control and distribution easy<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>MidCOM is a standardized way to build applications with midgard-php, meaning that it is much easier to get contributions to the code<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>MidCOM mandates using a strict coding and code documentation standard (although all code has not yet been ported to it)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>MidCOM provides the indexing service that allows building interesting views to data<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>...and finally, MidCOM is always available with Midgard<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In the most recent developments, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/development\/version_20\/\">OpenPSA 2.0<\/a> is being written using MidCOM, and similar plans are also around for a <a href=\"http:\/\/comments.gmane.org\/gmane.comp.web.midgard.user\/7264\">Aegir rewrite<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, even if most application development has moved to MidCOM, this doesn't yet force site maintainers to convert.

This would enable us to change the distribution strategy so that<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MidCOM framework ships as its own package<\/li>\n<li>Each component has its own package<\/li>\n<li>MidCOM distribution includes a <em>meta package<\/em> that depends on a set of <em>core components<\/em><\/li>\n<li>The <em>core components<\/em> would be chosen from the best quality and most general MidCOM components, and would include things like <em>de.linkm.taviewer<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Rest of the components could then be installed one-by-one using the <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/manual\/en\/installation.cli.php\">PEAR installer<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Besides removing clutter, PEAR packaging would also enable components and libraries to clearly state their dependencies from both MidCOM world and <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/packages.php\">PEAR packages<\/a>. This would promote code reuse and closer cooperation with the PEAR community.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Proof of concept<\/h2>\n\n<p>To test this approach, I created a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nehmer.net\/~bergie\/package.xml\">package definition<\/a> for the <em>net.nemein.personnel<\/em> component. It seemed quite easy to define the component in PEAR's format, although the package name had to use underscores instead of dots as class path separator, making it <em>net_nemein_personnel<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The package seemed to work quite well:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ pear package-validate package.xml\nValidation: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)\n\n$ pear package package.xml\n\n$ sudo pear install net_nemein_personnel-1.0.tgz\ninstall ok: net_nemein_personnel 1.0\n\n$ ls \/usr\/lib\/php\/midcom\/lib\/net\/nemein\/personnel\/\nadmin.php       locale          navigation.php  viewer.php\nconfig          midcom          style\n$ ls \/usr\/lib\/php\/docs\/net_nemein_personnel\/documentation\/\nCHANGES\n\n$ sudo pear uninstall net_nemein_personnel\nuninstall ok: net_nemein_personnel\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>With this experience, it looks like we should be able to quite easily <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zend.com\/pear\/tutorials\/howtopackage.php\">create the package definitions<\/a> for MidCOM files, and possibly also automate part of this work using the <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/package\/PEAR_PackageFileManager\">PEAR PackageFileManager<\/a> tool or some custom script.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only real change required in MidCOM to make the PEAR packaging work would be to change <em>midcom-template<\/em> to load MidCOM by default from the PEAR installation directory.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Distribution mechanisms<\/h2>\n\n<p>Once the packages have been done we have several options for distributing them:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Just providing them as downloads on the Midgard site<\/li>\n<li>Setting up our own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.schlitt.info\/applications\/blog\/index.php?\/archives\/308-Set-up-your-own-PEAR-channel.html\">PEAR 1.4 channel<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/manual\/en\/newmaint.when-to-contribute.php\">Contributing<\/a> the packages to the actual PEAR repository, and <em>midgard-php<\/em> to <a href=\"http:\/\/pecl.php.net\/\">PECL<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>The first of these options would be the easiest, and is probably the right way to start.

Big thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mp-asennus.com\/\">Mp-Asennus.com<\/a>, especially as they installed the Kawasaki starter ahead of schedule and under budget!<\/p>\n\n<p>I've been too busy to blog about all the stuff happening <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/2005\/05\/\">last month<\/a>, so here are some quick updates.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-89cdc78896523e71d9c2d07b5db216ac\/Suomenlinna_Nata_Kerttu.jpg\" alt=\"Nata and Kerttu on a Suomenlinna picnic\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Exorcism at work<\/h2>\n\n<p>One major problem with Content Management Systems has been that it has been very difficult to switch between systems as needs change or vendors go out of business. The <a href=\"http:\/\/psilib.sourceforge.net\/\">Portable Site Information<\/a> project was started to create an XML format for inter-CMS content transfers, but it failed to get traction.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our concept for solving this problem is the <a href=\"http:\/\/yukatan.fi\/confluence\/display\/yukatan\/2005\/02\/21\/CMS+migration+with+the+Exorcist\">Exorcist migration tool<\/a>, developed by original Midgard CMS founder and Java Content Repository guru <a href=\"http:\/\/zitting.name\/jukka\/JukkaZitting.html\">Jukka Zitting<\/a>. Exorcist provides an XML pipeline system for exporting content from a system, then transforming it to an appropriate format, and finally importing to another system. The XML transformations can be made either point-to-point, or using the PSI format.<\/p>\n\n<p>Point-to-point transformations have the advantage of being relatively loss-less, as they can map the features of different systems quite accurately. PSI on the other hand provides a generic format that all Exorcist-compatible systems must support as the lowest common denominator.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some time ago we <a href=\"http:\/\/yukatan.fi\/confluence\/display\/yukatan\/2005\/05\/18\/Using+the+Exorcist\">performed the first Exorcism<\/a>, successfully transferring three sites from EasySiter to Midgard CMS. All content and users were imported without problems, and only the site layout had to be manually converted. Exorcist uses the <a href=\"http:\/\/yukatan.fi\/confluence\/pages\/viewpage.action?pageId=65\">Midgard-Java<\/a> bindings to access the Midgard content structure.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-a46e25870f35dc80c35e0b57bf82fe3a\/Matsku_Jose_archery.jpg\" alt=\"Matsku and Jose practising archery in Aallonranta\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>New Nemein team member<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/team\/tktuomin.html\">Topi Tuominen<\/a> joined the Nemein team today.

Midgard boasts a feature set you'd expect from any decent CMS: web-based authoring, image asset management, clean URL's, roll-back, and a built-in search engine. Midgard only recently came to OS X and I'm glad they finally released an easy installer.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 2005-08-22:<\/strong> Updated download count from 300 to 600.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/more-about-positioning-on-the-web\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"More about positioning on the web","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-08-26 18:16:47","atom:content":"<p>I've posted thoughts about <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-permalink-daa03fa102895dd8766637e8c584b453\">using location information<\/a> on the web and my blog has been associating position information and weather on <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-permalink-d46e18692c12ea8655f59f1182e87843\">city level<\/a> into all documents there since last December. However, this data isn't very useful yet as such. As the city-level information doesn't contain coordinates, I can't:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Find blog entries or photos from nearby<\/li>\n<li>Make the blog entries searchable by systems like <a href=\"http:\/\/geourl.org\/\">GeoURL<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Place the photos <a href=\"http:\/\/brainoff.com\/worldkit\/index.php\">on a map<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>To fix these problems I need to switch to storing locations based on coordinates, and make the positions more accurate than just the city. This brings me to the big problem location information, just like all metadata has: cost of producing it. If I need to figure out and manually type the current location every time I post an entry, I won't do it. So, the procedure has to be more automated than that.<\/p>\n\n<p>I think the approach I've been taking so far with location information of entries is pretty good, as the information is <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/archive\/locations\/\">stored centrally<\/a> (I was in Helsinki from July 17th to 21st), and then entries get their position by matching my track to their creation timestamp. Now my system does this only on per-day level, but it would be easy to match on actual timestamps.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a person can be only in one place at a time, this system should be quite foolproof. Also, it makes it easy to \"mass-locate\" data, and to correct location information afterwards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently I maintain the position information via SMS. But for more accurate reporting, this would obviously become expensive and bothersome. When we were in Moscow <a href=\"http:\/\/wooga.drbacchus.com\/wordpress\/?p=950\">Rich Bowen had an idea<\/a> about getting the location information based on current network, and now there actually is a service for doing this. <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.plazes.com\/\">Plazes<\/a> uses a small desktop applet called <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.plazes.com\/info\/files\/\">Launcher<\/a> for storing current network identifier, which then is connected to a location. As your Plazes information can be queried via a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeplaze.com\/documentation\/whereami\/\">WhereAmI web service<\/a>, it would be easy to set up a cron job to update the position data in Midgard using this information:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-f03394f53ac68bd910c9cc140b077d1f\/plazes-whereis-bergie.jpg\" alt=\"Where is Bergie?\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>While Plazes can solve the problem of positioning entries made when in normal network or office environments, for more <a href=\"http:\/\/www.horizonsunlimited.com\/\">adventurous<\/a> locations importing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.topografix.com\/gpx.asp\">GPX logs<\/a> from a GPS device might be optimal.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 16:42:<\/strong> One point to consider however, is that this approach just marks items posted from a location, not necessarily <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microformats.org\/wiki\/location-formats#What_People_are_Publishing\">about a location<\/a>.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/openpsa-calendar-goes-horizontal\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"OpenPsa Calendar goes horizontal","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-08-26 19:19:02","atom:content":"<p>After a bit of thought we've returned the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/midcom-permalink-92985cb9b0360b4e807716fa9e2ff8c3\">Group Calendar module<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPsa 2<\/a> to using horizontal layout for days.

They were supporters of the late <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zviad_Gamsakhurdia\">Zviad Gamsakhurdia<\/a> who were demonstrating against us \"Imperialist swine\". They gave way to our car, however, and we were able to drive to the first meeting of the day.<\/p>\n\n<p>The eRiders were setting up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kubuntu.org\/\">Kubuntu<\/a> to the \"First School\" of Georgia where most of the national leaders have graduated. While waiting for the installations to complete we were given a tour of the premises, which were still being renovated after the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Georgian_Civil_War\">Georgian civil war<\/a>. While short of its former glory, the school included several computer rooms, museum, and even a chapel.<\/p>\n\n<p>After the school installations we went to meet the IT people of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parliament.ge\/\">Georgian parliament<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computer.org.ge\/\">Georgian Computer Society<\/a>. We demoed Ubuntu installation for them, and talked about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a>. Especially the possibilities of Midgard in eLearning sector would be very promising.

The market also supplied a staggering number of different wines, and even the local rarity: dark beer. We chopped the meat, onions and peppers and left them to stew together, and drove to a special bean restaurant near the ancient capital of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mtskheta\">Mtskheta<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>After stuffing ourselves with beans and <a href=\"http:\/\/ilforno.typepad.com\/il_forno\/2004\/01\/khachapuri_chee.html\">khachapuri<\/a> we went to the 11th century <a href=\"http:\/\/www.world66.com\/europe\/georgia\/mtskheta\">Sveticxoveli<\/a> church. The church was being renovated after decades of neglect during the Soviet times, and was bustling with activity. In addition to a mass there was a constant procession of weddings going on. Some of the old murals were interesting, showing monsters, alleged UFOs and Christ surrounded by signs of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zodiac\">Zodiac<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-a42ee416180feeb83ef3371b2eb2bc66\/Church_inside_the_church.jpg\" alt=\"Church-inside-a-church in Sveticxoveli\" title=\"\" \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-d72ad7a43bb17fdeed24f614664d1e25\/Tiko_lights_a_candle.jpg\" alt=\"Tiko lights a candle in the church\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The next location for the tour was the old monastery nearby. There we were unable to enter the church because of my shorts, but we saw the graveyard and the garden where holy oil comes from the ground. Everywhere old beggars were selling bottles of this oil of claimed miraculous properties.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also climbed to the ruins of a fortress guarding the <a href=\"http:\/\/vdjorbenadze.tripod.com\/Kazbegi\/Kazbegi.htm\">Georgian Military Highway<\/a> leading up to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.world66.com\/europe\/georgia\/kazbegi\">Kazbegi<\/a> and Ossetia in the north.

The concrete structure of the house was in a small village behind about twelve kilometers of very bumpy road, with very beautiful views down to the forested hills and Tbilisi below.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cows and stray dogs were touring the grounds while we prepared the fire and roasted some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.russianfoods.com\/recipes\/item0012A\/default.asp\">basturma meat<\/a> we'd made earlier on skewers.

They were interested in possibilities of building a learning portal for teachers of public schools. Since we've done some similar tools for Finnish educational organizations we were able to offer some advice on how to do it with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">proper CMS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Taya needed to handle some paperwork related to obtaining a passport for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/gallery\/black-sea-2004\/IMG_5511\">Tiko<\/a>. Ever curious, I wanted to see how the Georgian bureaucratic machine worked. First we drove to an office to get a driver's license with changed surname for Taya. Then we had to pay some registration fees at a bank, and after that visit another office to get Tiko's paperwork running.<\/p>\n\n<p>There however the lady running the office went through the papers and noticed that in one of them, Taya's birth-date had a typo in it. With this information we had to drive fifteen kilometers to another office to request it to be fixed. However, they declined to make the fix, as we did not have a written request for fixing by the previous office.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-ea05c86e8126322f68148f59bc4a3252\/Georgian_Road_Works_Department.jpg\" alt=\"Georgian Department of Road Works\" title=\"\" \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-b5f68cbe3fd66e4955ad9c551f9d4507\/Biergarten_Stelze_dinner.jpg\" alt=\"Dinner in the Biergarten\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>At this point most of the day had already been spent, and so we had to return to the Soros building to set up the first public Midgard server there. We met the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grena.ge\/english\/index.html\">GRENA<\/a> system administrator, and he helped us set the server's network settings. We also fixed some booting issues by properly setting up <a href=\"http:\/\/packages.debian.org\/stable\/admin\/apmd\">apmd<\/a> on the system.<\/p>\n\n<p>For dinner we went to Stelze, a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Biergarten\">German biergarten<\/a> -style place.

The complete operating budget for 2006 will be estimated at 300k&euro;, compiled from member organizations and Finnish public funding.<\/p>\n\n<p>The focus areas for COSS in 2006 will be lobbying Open Source and Open Standards in the Finnish public sector, helping member companies in their business development, and acting as a central international contact point for the Finnish Open Source industry.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Open Source business research<\/h2>\n\n<p>OSSI is a research project funded by Tekes and run by HUT, Kauppakorkeakoulu, and other research organizations. Its 800k&euro; budget makes it one of the largest OSS research projects in European public sector. The project is now in early stage, with its website and blog expected to open soon.<\/p>\n\n<p>OSSI's sister project ServOSS is a development project for building internationalized Open Source professional services business. The project is mainly funded by Tekes, and is still looking for corporate partners operating in the OSS services industry. Participation fee for companies is 2500&euro;.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Localization issues<\/h2>\n\n<p>Finnish OSS localization project, <em>\"Kotoistaminen\"<\/em>, got organized in summer 2005. Keeps \"volunteer\" localization work of OSS projects open, but tries to fund the trouble spots. Currently normal desktop environments and major applications like OpenOffice.org and Firefox are localized, but the quality differs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The localization project aims to build a bounty system to allow end-user organizations to fund translation work. In addition to actual user interfaces, help texts and documentation should be translated, but this process is still severely lagging.<\/p>\n\n<p>One idea for boosting localization efforts would be to utilize the Rosetta web-based translation tool from Ubuntu's Launchpad project. Rosetta allows different translations for a string to be submitted, and then project owner can choose the best option. Rosetta would be an excellent tool for Midgard's localization as well, but this would require the proposed transition to Gettext.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finnish Ministry of Justice will be piloting usage of OpenOffice.org 2.x in 2006, and for them the quality of localizations will be important. Spell checking is also imperative. Currently Finnish spell checking can be handled through the Soikko application, but it doesn't run on Windows.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hunspell-fi.org\/\">Hunspell-fi<\/a> aims to create a spell and grammar checker that supports difficult languages like Finnish and Hungarian on multiple platforms, and could be a Soikko replacement.<\/p>\n\n<h2>OpenSynchro<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensynchro.org\/\">OpenSynchro<\/a> is a GPLd integration tool developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smilehouse.fi\/\">SmileHouse<\/a>, a proprietary web store vendor  for connecting web stores with warehouse management, procurement systems, ePayment systems, etc. The idea with OpenSynchro has been to make eBusiness system integration easier with it than with regular EAI tools.<\/p>\n\n<p>OpenSynchro can be used for transferring product, order or customer information across different systems. It can also be used for ad-hoc data migration needs, placing it to similar usage area as the <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/exorcist\">Exorcist<\/a> migration tool for Content Management Systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>OpenSynchro was developed with public funding, and its Open Sourcing decision was partly based on desire to give something back to the community. SmileHouse also sees it as a better marketing method than making it another proprietary product.<\/p>\n\n<p>The target users of OpenSynchro are in the SME sector, as there eBusiness integration is most severely lacking. Being based on Java, MySQL and Tomcat makes it quite platform agnostic. It includes several component plugins like XSLT, SMTP and others. The base architecture is familiar from Exorcist, providing source (exporter), converter (transformer) and target (importer) parts. The system can be configured over the web.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Nokia 770<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/europe.nokia.com\/nokia\/0,1522,,00.html?orig=\/770\">N770<\/a> is the Linux and Open Source usage pilot for Nokia. It is also Nokia's entry to the broadband device business. It is sold directly from Nokia.com, bypassing the traditional reseller channel. The target market is portal companies and broadband network providers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Boot time is about 38 seconds. After that, online access can be handled either via WLAN, or using bluetooth connection to a mobile phone. The device can be controlled by some buttons, and a stylus stored inside the hard case. For typing the options are a virtual on-screen keyboard, or a <a href=\"http:\/\/europe.nokia.com\/nokia\/0,,58982,00.html\">bluetooth keyboard<\/a>. For easier reading, the whole screen of N770 supports zooming.<\/p>\n\n<p>The left-hand bar provides the access buttons to the main use cases; web bookmarks, email and other applications. The idea is that the device is a web browser, not a full computer or a smart phone. However, other applications can be installed as .deb packages, and they will appear in the \"Others\" menu.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.maemo.org\/\">Maemo<\/a> is the Open Source community kicked up by Nokia to support third-party developers building applications for the N770. The next product for the series will be a software package adding VoIP support. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maemo.org\/community\/hildon_ui.html\">Hildon<\/a> user interface is based on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/\">GNOME<\/a> libraries. Nokia tries to work actively together with the Open Source communities their tools are based on.<\/p>\n\n<p>N770 could prove to be an interesting tool for keeping meeting notes and handling <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPsa<\/a> tasks on the road.

This is obviously a big change for everybody used to work either in the <a href=\"http:\/\/an9.org\/devdev\/why_frameworks_suck?sxip-homesite&amp;checked=1\">free-form fashion<\/a>, or using one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotscripts.com\/PHP\/Scripts_and_Programs\/Development_Tools\/Application_Framework\/\">community-built frameworks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The need for consistency<\/h2>\n\n<p>However, even though I'm a developer in one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\/\">PHP application frameworks<\/a>, I see the need for some standardization. Now the common ground shared between all the different PHP frameworks is just the language itself, forcing all projects to focus on building lots of low-level plumbing infrastructure instead of focusing on the features that could differentiate the applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each application project or framework having to write their own low-level services means that by large the applications are not compatible with each other. If you want to for instance run a site that would contain blogs (using <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">Wordpress<\/a>), forums (using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplemachines.org\/\">SM Forum<\/a>) and photo galleries (using <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.menalto.com\/\">Gallery<\/a>), each of them would most likely use different user and permission system, style templates and configuration tools.<\/p>\n\n<p>This kind of inconsistency has lead to the state where each framework and CMS <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-permalink-551a106fbbce70d7478a0fa434cc48bf\">rolls their own<\/a> instead of using the best-of-breed PHP applications. This means huge amount of wasted effort, and an opportunity for other programming environments like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rubyonrails.org\/\">Ruby on Rails<\/a> to pass PHP frameworks in functionality and appeal.<\/p>\n\n<p>This situation is similar to the effort wasted by all the different Linux <a href=\"http:\/\/linuxresource.com\/X_Window_System\/Desktop_Environments\/index.php\">desktop environments<\/a> in the past. However, instead of two or three serious contenders, the ease of PHP development has given rise to hundreds of different frameworks and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hotscripts.com\/PHP\/Scripts_and_Programs\/Content_Management\/\">content management systems<\/a>. In the desktop environment scene, the different projects are <a href=\"http:\/\/freedesktop.org\/wiki\/\">already collaborating<\/a> on lots of the <a href=\"http:\/\/freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Standards\">base infrastructure<\/a>, and are now starting to do the same in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tango-project.org\/\">look-and-feel space<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If done well, the Zend Framework <em>could<\/em> do the same for PHP projects. If done badly, it would merely introduce a yet another framework to the space.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Midgard point-of-view<\/h2>\n\n<p>Looking at the still-vapourwareish Zend Framework from the point-of-view of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard Project<\/a>, I see the possibility of benefitting from it. Currently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/development\/projects\/midcom\/\">MidCOM 2.5 framework<\/a> is about 75k lines of code. Much of this is because functionalities like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nathan-syntronics.de\/midcom-permalink-7105771203e762aa01902dbdb96150ca\">ACL<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-7856ea3bafeccf218226ec3cd8f05df8\">style engine<\/a> have not yet been rolled into the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-c477cb2263057e6c32fef6c364b21a1f\">Midgard Core<\/a>, but also because lots of other base infrastructure like localization must still be done by MidCOM.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, if you think about Midgard, it consists of several separate parts:<\/p>\n\n<h3>Data abstraction layer<\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema\/\">MgdSchema<\/a> allows developers to abstract the database storage, and use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgardquerybuilder\/\">query tools<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nathan-syntronics.de\/midcom-permalink-7105771203e762aa01902dbdb96150ca\">access controls<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-7856ea3bafeccf218226ec3cd8f05df8\">extensibility<\/a> with it. As common database abstraction is one of the Zend Framework goals, the way to access these tools would possibly change for PHP-level Midgard. But as Midgard's scope extends outside the PHP world also to <a href=\"http:\/\/www-128.ibm.com\/developerworks\/java\/library\/j-jcr\/\">Java Content Repositories<\/a>, using a straight SQL abstraction system would be out of question. It remains to be seen, if Midgard's database abstraction layer could be used as a storage provider for the Zend Framework.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Style Engine<\/h3>\n\n<p>Templating and page assemply have traditionally been the strong points of Midgard, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/Feature\/83-Supergroup\">often<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/Feature\/131-CMS-Marketplace\">noted<\/a> by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/Feature\/96-2nd-Annual-Supergroup\">CMS Watch<\/a>. The power of it was slightly broken by the double standard imposed by MidCOM, but this is now getting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/development\/mrfc\/0022.html\">wrapped back together<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The style engine and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-host_and_page\/\">URL handling<\/a> of Midgard is definitely something that should be still possible to keep as-is, even if something like Zend Framework would be used beneath.<\/p>\n\n<h3>User interfaces<\/h3>\n\n<p>The user interface layer would benefit a lot of collaboration and shared tools. We're planning to follow <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tango-project.org\/\">Tango<\/a> visuals and the <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.gnome.org\/projects\/gup\/hig\/\">GNOME Human Interface Guidelines<\/a> to quite a big degree in Midgard. This part of UI is best collaborated using shared CSS rules and XHTML naming standards like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microformats.org\/\">Microformats<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, form handling and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/links\/ajax.html\">AJAX<\/a> are something where the Zend Framework could make things easier, consistent and <a href=\"http:\/\/shiflett.org\/archive\/164\">more secure<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Development tools<\/h3>\n\n<p>The Zend Framework also has the possibility of making <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/\">Eclipse<\/a> the standard development environment for PHP development. As this is already the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/using-eclipse-for-midcom-development\/\">recommendation for Midgard developers<\/a>, we are obviously eager to see the rise of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phpeclipse.de\/tiki-view_articles.php\">better PHP tools<\/a> for it.<\/p>\n\n<h2>So, what's going to happen?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The Zend Framework project seems to be still a quite early stages, and despite claims that some code and specs exist, they still remain to be seen by the PHP developer community. Even in this stage, it would be crucial for the Zend Framework project to be available for peer review. Otherwise, it will be seen as just a corporate intrusion into the formerly open PHP framework space. Statements like this don't help much:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We're now working on setting up the collaboration infrastructure and engagement guidelines. We expect to have them ready by January 2006. In the meantime, we will use this medium to share progress on the project development.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I feel some urgency in seeing what is going on and planned in the project. The Midgard community is now starting to refactor the MidCOM framework to work on <a href=\"http:\/\/midcom.tigris.org\/issues\/show_bug.cgi?id=284\">PHP5<\/a>, and to utilize new language features like interface classes and exceptions. At the same time we're starting to utilize functionalities moved from MidCOM to Midgard Core. This would be the optimal spot to take the Zend Framework into mind if it was available, making MidCOM even more consistent with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/Trends\/561-Discussing-KISS-and-OSS-in-polite-company?source=RSS\">KISS ideology<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As we in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/\">Midgard community<\/a> have quite a bit of experience with PHP component architecture, and with following <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-2e4394b43693dc6c5c6b7ae77037b4c3\">strict coding standards<\/a>, we could have some things to contribute to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zend.com\/collaboration\/\">PHP Collaboration Project<\/a>, but unfortunately the process is still closed.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/finnish-midgard-slides-from-friday\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Finnish Midgard slides from friday","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-11-13 17:07:49","atom:content":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-ef1c2ba952201340ffa05b6bc092cb6b\/midgard-project.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"120\" width=\"120\" alt=\"Midgard Project\" style=\"margin-left: 10px;\" align=\"right\" \/>\nHere are the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a> slides we presented to two major potential Finnish customers on friday:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-3c38a29018216fe98ca893c38fe69198\/Midgard_CMS-20051111.pdf\">Midgard presentation in Finnish (256 KB PDF)<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>While the slides were made half-asleep on an early morning train from the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/finnish-centre-for-open-source-software-in-2006.html\">Tampere COSS meeting<\/a> and are so not very <a href=\"http:\/\/presentationzen.blogs.com\/presentationzen\/\">presentation Zen<\/a> ish, they try to focus on couple of key points with Midgard and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">Nemein<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Midgard's standard integration interfaces like Java Content Repository<\/li>\n<li>Connectivity to Midgard from different client tools; mobile phones, browsers, etc<\/li>\n<li>Nemein's strong client portfolio<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It went across quite well to both organizations.

In the latter half of 2005 I've noticed myself starting to pay a lot more attention, and actually use things like <em>AJAX<\/em>, <em>Javascript<\/em>, <em>fluid layouts<\/em>, <em>CSS versions for handhelds<\/em>, and obviously, <em>rounded corners<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main complaint for the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/links\/ajax.html\">AJAX<\/a> hype has been that the technology has been around for a long time already. But just like with CSS and RSS, it took a while before there was enough knowledge and compelling case examples of AJAX around for people to actually trust in the technology. Javascript incompatibilities bit web developers badly in the old days, and it takes a while to get over it.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> predictions for 2006, it is actually a bit difficult to pick the right trends. So huge amount of stuff happened in 2005 that we never could anticipate. What I'd like to happen though would be:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Simplification<\/strong> - Removing all the unnecessary UIs and other legacy cruft as we near the 2.0 release<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Clarification<\/strong> - Making the strong points of Midgard like the templating system, editable content schemas and the plethora of components more clearly visible for end users<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Connectivity<\/strong> - Starting to really use tools like RSS, microformats and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digital-ecosystem.org\/\">DBE<\/a> for connecting sites and servers with each other<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Performance<\/strong> - The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-c25d278a232a61cc6218d726215916e4\">metadata system<\/a> in MidCOM 2.4 hurt Midgard's performance quite badly, and we really need to get it back<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These, together with all the application development projects into the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPsa<\/a> suite we've been contracted to do will make 2006 quite a busy year.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the-environmental-impact-of-the-internet\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"The environmental impact of the Internet","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2005-12-10 13:43:42","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sun.com\/\">Sun's<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/jonathan\">Jonathan Schwartz<\/a> is talking about the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/roller\/page\/jonathan?entry=let_s_change_this\">environmental impact of the Internet<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the negative, remember California's power crisis?

That's why they're building datacenters next to smelting plants. Seriously. Read this.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Three MILLION people a week are joining the internet. If each gets a Dell PC, consuming 200 watts, that's 10-20 GIGAwatts of new power draw and a massive impact on the planet. If we're serious about creating technologies developing companies and economies can afford, something has to change.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>...<\/p>\n  \n  <p>And both bet on a simple premise. Over my lifetime, I will consume roughly three times the power my parents consumed - and they, roughly three times their parents. As that trend continues, energy efficiency will become a competitive advantage for Sun (alongside Toyota, Boeing and GE) - and an environmental imperative for governments and voters. You may not care about it in your den, but multiply your den by three million, and I guarantee you, there's a lot to care about.

What is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nokia.com\/770\">770<\/a> + Internet + <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/\">Wikipedia<\/a>? Quite much same as Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Galaxy. An electronic device that can answer to all your questions anywhere anytime. It is not Sci-Fi anylonger, but Nokia 770 Internet Tablet\u2026<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I fully agree that there is the potential. I've been long thinking about something like this, but I still feel that an offline version would be important. You might need information about places when traveling, or answers to some question that popped in a conversation. And Internet connection might just not be available.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the full WikiPedia would take too much storage space, the device could possibly use a text-only version. And even then the contents <a href=\"http:\/\/download.wikimedia.org\/\">downloaded<\/a> for offline usage could be optimized based on some smart categorization and for example based on the user's current location that could be gotten through sources like a Bluetooth GPS receiver, or a network's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plazes.com\/\">Plazes<\/a> information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Maybe something like the <a href=\"http:\/\/only.mawhrin.net\/fbreader\/maemo\/\">FBReader<\/a> e-book reader, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.internettablettalk.com\/blog\/?p=207\">suggested by Internet Tablet Users<\/a> could work together with an RSS-like system to update content from WikiPedia to the tablet.<\/p>\n\n<p>The user interface would be quite obvious: text saying <em>Don't Panic<\/em> in big, friendly letters, a search box, and list of probable pages of interest based on location.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now what is especially cool about the N770 and WikiPedia combination is that there is no central authority to convince to be able to build this. WikiPedia is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Copyrights\">open content<\/a>, and Nokia 770's platform is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maemo.org\/\">fully open<\/a>, meaning that anybody can just sit down and implement this.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, in projects like this is important to remember that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.corante.com\/many\/archives\/2005\/12\/17\/wikipedia_academia_and_seigenthaler.php\">WikiPedia is an encyclopedia<\/a>, not the full sum of human knowledge:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But Jimmy Wales reminded me that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, not a library replacement.

Journalist Judith Miller was released from jail and said she wanted to hug her dog. U.S. Congressman Tom DeLay was arrested; U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff I. Lewis &ldquo;Scooter&rdquo; Libby was indicted. The Pentagon admitted to using white phosphorus during the 2004 attack on Fallujah, Iraq, and allocated $127 billion to build a robot army. The total number of American soldiers killed in the Iraq war rose to 2,174, while the total number of Iraqi civilians killed rose to 27,636. &ldquo;We are all waiting for death,&rdquo; said an Iraqi soldier, &ldquo;like the moon waiting for sunset.&rdquo; The U.S. Defense Department, in violation of the federal Privacy Act, was building a database of 30 million 16- to 25-year-olds. The Department of Homeland Security announced that it had wasted a great deal of money and needed much more. Starbucks came to Guantanamo Bay. Scientists began work on a complete, molecule-level computer simulation of the human brain.

If the company is found, the OpenPsa service will then replicate all tasks and hour reports related to the remote user to the other company's installation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remote users and local users are identified in person listings by different icons: satellite dish for remote user, and a person image for local user.<\/p>\n\n<h2>System architecture<\/h2>\n\n<p>Since OpenPsa has been implemented as set of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-fc278b300819f654e0e561c6e233c67f\">MidCOM<\/a> components written in PHP, it can't connect with DBE directly. To make the connection, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-8d125757a16d36c7cde202561554d21c\">Exorcist<\/a> is being run as the <em>DBE Service<\/em>. It watches for changes in the Midgard database, and replicates them across the DBE network as required. Here's roughly how it works:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-412ef01605cb98f01d84c3b2920054fe\/openpsa-dbe-connection.png\" alt=\"OpenPsa DBE connection\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Security model<\/h2>\n\n<p>When the OpenPsa DBE service was developed there was no <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ercim.org\/publication\/Ercim_News\/enw63\/seigneur.html\">Identity System<\/a> for DBE, and so at the moment the service must be run over <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Virtual_private_network\">VPN<\/a> to be secure. We will look at utilizing the new DBE security module in the next project.<\/p>\n\n<p>For us the challenge obviously is that with OpenPsa users authenticate with their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midcom-permalink-c4e7fde9b7935d59b18ffc1f998e8a21\">Midgard accounts<\/a>, and so DBE identity can only be established on per-company level. We'll have to see how well this works with the DBE security module.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In related news<\/strong>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joelonsoftware.com\/articles\/Micro-ISV.html\">Joel Spolsky talks about Micro-ISVs<\/a>, one of the target markets for the networked Openpsa.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/getting-things-done-with-salesforce-com\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Getting Things Done with Salesforce.com","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2006-01-19 07:01:01","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/itredux.com\/blog\/\">IT Redux<\/a> has a story about <a href=\"http:\/\/itredux.com\/blog\/office-20\/getting-things-done-with-office-20\/\">managing GTD with Salesforce.com<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the item is not actionable, I trash it, store it as a long-term goal or attach a note to an object, both using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/\">Salesforce.com<\/a> as data repository.

A goal has a long-range timeframe attached to it, which can either be the current year, next year, within five years, within ten years, or within one\u2019s lifetime. A goal with a five years timeframe could be the buying of a house for example. The decision to use a note rather than a goal is based on the fact that a note does not have a timeframe. It\u2019s a simple piece of information that I want to make sure I will be able to retrieve when looking up the object it is attached to.

These capabilities will originate from diverse vendors or providers, and expose customized sets of functionality and information specific to the individual enterprise.

The hail was the size of golf balls, and as we were driving the shepherds on the side of the roads were donning construction-style helmets.<\/p>\n\n<p>But still, the hail melted almost as quickly as it hit the ground, and so we continued with our trunk of warm beer. Driving around another bend, we suddenly saw a pile of hail balls lying in the middle of a clearing.

Now all times are supposed to be in the server's local timezone, meaning that you need to calculate the timezoned times into your local time. Would be a great idea and not very difficult to add optional timezone pulldown to the editor though.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Allow my assistant to enter appointments and see my schedule, although some things may be private.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The calendar events in the editor may be marked <em>Public<\/em> or <em>Private<\/em>.

Surprisingly many of the hot new Ajax calendars omitted this basic feature because they're web apps. At the very least, I'd like something to pop up on Windows, which means a downloadable widget, and an SMS message on my cell phone. Different meetings need different advance warnings ... I need to be notified 3 hours before a flight at Kennedy but 3 minutes before a meeting in my office.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>OpenPsa calendar doesn't support alerts yet. With the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/midcom-permalink-72bcc2a46ce396afc5b5fd3c4ffa33b5\">OpenPsa version 1 calendar<\/a> you could edit the events via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/people\/rambo\/openpsa_1_11_11_and_ical.html\">webcal<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/people\/rambo\/calendar_syncml.html\">SyncML<\/a>, and the alerts would be handled by your mobile phone, or a desktop calendar subscribed to the event feed.<\/p>\n\n<p>We haven't ported this feature to OpenPsa 2 yet.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Print out something reasonable that I can take with me before a trip listing my complete schedule for the trip. Some of my appointments have driving directions or complicated notes attached. I just want a list of where I need to be, when, and it's surprising that very few online calendars can handle this.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, this was something OpenPsa 2 did well with its <em>Week list<\/em> feature. OpenPsa 2 is fully <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/wiki\/hcalendar\">hCalendar<\/a> and CSS, and so creating a suitable <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alistapart.com\/articles\/goingtoprint\/\">print CSS<\/a> should be easy.<\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, these were important points about attention to detail.

I became much less concerned of this world; started consuming more since I earned much more, bought a car and instead of using my feet, a bike or public transportation (which in capital area of Finland works extremely well), I started - again - to let myself be away of this moment in a dreamy state.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>And the stress aspect:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I am in a bus, I can meditate if I wish. I can wander in my thoughts or just be. I can fully concentrate on the moment and watch out my mind from drifting.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>One more reason for me not to drive to work is that my stress level goes down this way. First of all, driving is still stressing while there is other traffic - and there always is. Second, when sitting in the bus, when waiting for the bus or when walking in between bus stops I am usually just relaxing and enjoying the moment.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>I notice those beautiful icicles, I stop to enjoy the spring sun. I see the beauty of a single snow-flake, I enjoy the cold wind on my face. This is heavily connected to me being here, and me noticing all the beauty in even very unexpected places.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>These reasons are quite close to why I'm also happy commuting using public transport. Of course, schedules being tight this often <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/bad_taxi_day.html\">means a taxi<\/a> but still at least the latter point is valid.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summers I commute <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/bikes\/triumph-legend.html\">by motorbike<\/a>, but that has nothing to do with ecology and everything to do with fun.

The main issue in the <a href=\"http:\/\/oscom.org\/get-involved\/mailing-lists\/general\/2006-February\/000744.html\">stormy discussion<\/a> was the question whether the association should be dissolved or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>The OSCOM <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/get-involved\/organization\/\">association<\/a> was founded in 2002 to further collaboration and standardization between Open Source Content Management System projects.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What OSCOM did well<\/h2>\n\n<p>OSCOM was unique that in a very competitive and split field it was able to bring people together from many different projects and companies to work together. As Sandro summarized:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>well, what's the reason for OSCOM? it's that we don't  want to play the stupid we-are-competitors-and-we-dont-talk-but-fight- each-other game<\/p>\n  \n  <p>we at least want to talk with each other, because we  respect our expertise and we can learn from each other<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This worked quite well, especially in the first two years. I went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/oscom-1\/\">OSCOM 1<\/a> expecting to only pitch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> against competitors, but actually ended up learning quite a bit and having lots of fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Things started becoming even more promising when several <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/projects\/\">cross-CMS development projects<\/a> were started. It was an especially nice moment when we were able to demo the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/Projects\/Twingle\/\">Twingle offline editor<\/a> editing content in three different systems at the end of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/sprints\/1--zurich-march-2003\/\">first Sprint<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>But during 2004 things started to decline, and since <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/oscom4\/\">OSCOM 4<\/a> the association has been existing mostly in an \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Undead\">undead<\/a>\" state.<\/p>\n\n<h2>And what went wrong<\/h2>\n\n<p>OSCOM's biggest problem was that it failed to recruit new active people into the association. When the CMS market started doing better most of the formerly active members became simply too busy to participate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Several cross-CMS projects were started by people outside the OSCOM community that could've been OSCOM activities with a bit of effort. Especially the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscms-summit.org\/\">Open Source CMS Summit<\/a> in Vancouver this month and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensourcecms.com\/\">Open Source CMS site<\/a> come to mind.<\/p>\n\n<p>Discussion in the meeting was on whether the association should be dissolved or not. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sandrozic.de\/\">Sandro Groganz<\/a> took the task of producing a new plan for making OSCOM work, and the discussion was suspended until <strong>March 2nd<\/strong> so that this plan can be presented.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wish the best for Sandro's efforts. OSCOM has been a great initiative and it has been sad to see it decline.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/decluttering-process\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Decluttering process","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2006-02-24 19:52:40","atom:content":"<p>During this week we've hauled about one and half <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/gallery\/poznan-2004\/IMG_1954\">Land Rover<\/a> loads of furniture and old stuff to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ytv.fi\/ENG\/waste\/household_waste\/\">recycling<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-98bdb1f39c74cd8929f1fd1abe8f6947\/Decluttering_project.jpg\" alt=\"Decluttering in process\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>I have to say <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nomoreclutter.co.uk\/faq.html\">decluttering<\/a> feels really good.

If not for this trial, our archaeological experiment would remain inconclusive, leaving the consistency of reconstructed withy-sewing technique under some doubt. So we did not take shortest rout for our voyage, on the contrary, we strived to use all available time up for more sailing. The resulting route was following: Koskosalma - Kuganavolok - [land transport] - Kashino - Povenets - Kizhi - Olen Isles - Petrozavodsk - Povenets - [towed trough Belomor canal] - Belomorsk - Solovki - Sonostrov - Krasnaya bay - Solovki.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Along Onego lake and White sea shnjaka covered some 900 km, under her own sail, moreover, part of this way (200 km) she towed another 8 meter boat. Total sailing time, with anchor hoisted, amounted to ~220 hours, which puts average travelling speed at ~ 4 km\/h. Not very impressing, but this result can be stated in more optimistic fashion -- our daily average progress was 100 km (4.1km\/h * 24h = 100km). Highest speed in this expedition, sustained for some 10 hours, was 6-7 knots, or 11-13km\/h.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The trip was definitely an interesting one, and I'm happy to hear they were able to reach the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/White_Sea\">White Sea<\/a> even after the bureaucratic issues at <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/White_Sea-Baltic_Canal\">Stalin's Channel<\/a>.\nTime constraints forced me to leave the ship after the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lake_Onega\">Onega<\/a> leg.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-d881c6f783ae0d295f056d2238366c47\/Shjaka_sailing.jpg\" alt=\"Shnjaka sailing on the Lake Onega\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/building-a-better-mousetrap\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Building a better mousetrap","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2006-03-01 21:39:19","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisglass.com\/\">Chris Glass<\/a> has posted a HOWTO on a <a href=\"http:\/\/glass.typepad.com\/journal\/2005\/09\/how_to_catch_a_.html\">more humane mousetrap<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-3f8ed071756048078a4003fb4d061297\/humane-mousetrap.jpg\" alt=\"Humane mousetrap illustration by Chris Glass\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n  \n  <p>Balance the tube precariously on the edge of a table or counter with the treat hanging directly over the tall sided receptacle.\n  The mouse will scurry to the treat (they like tunnels) and fall into the trap.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I learned this technique from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0438626\/\">Kapulainen<\/a> kids when spending childhood summers in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Archipelago_Sea\">Turku archipelago<\/a>.

It seems they are willing to consider PEAR packaging the Framework once they get it to a more complete stage. That would be a very good step, as then other packages like Midgard could easily depend on parts of the Framework.<\/p>\n\n<p>They're currently also looking at the different component architectures. I showed a quick demo of how MidCOM components are constructed and configured. Obviously MidCOM is quite specific to Midgard but some ideas from it might still be useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally I was a bit wary of the Zend Framework before actually meeting Andi. He got me convinced that they're actually trying to do the right things for the community, but are trying to be careful and only publish ready stuff at the same time.

But then <a href=\"http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0116506\/\">Paul Everitt<\/a> told about his way of blogging: keeping blog as a centralized place to post information people ask about. With blogs you have a URL for each post you can point people to when they ask about something.<\/p>\n\n<p>This wasn't the first time I was blogging. I had what nowadays would be called a weblog on my site in 1997-98, and have blogged several of my motorcycle trips to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/journal\/\">Routa MC Journals<\/a>. However, this was the first time I started to actively maintain a centralized weblog.<\/p>\n\n<p>During this time the site has grown from about 50 daily visitors to over 2000. That figure is quite close to major consumer portals in Finland. The blog is featured on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/planet\/\">several<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.planet-php.net\/\">Planet<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/planet.oscom.org\/\">aggregators<\/a>, and so is probably seen by even bigger number of people. This clearly shows there is demand for the blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the more questionable side, the blog has also managed to annoy somebody enough to <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.phpdoc.info\/archives\/15-Planet-PHP-Annoyances-and-a-solution!.html\">write code to censor it<\/a>. I have to admit I've been posting long entries, entries with lots of pictures, and entries about very specific subjects that may not be relevant to everybody.

For example,\nIBM, Sun and Intel have all assigned full-time developers to work on the \nproject<\/li>\n<li>In addition to the big players, several small companies working on Free\nSoftware business applications have been funded to integrate their \napplications<\/li>\n<li>DBE project was started couple years ago, and the first running version of \nthe software was released in summer 2005 through Sourceforge<\/li>\n<li>The reason why European Union started this project is to make local small \nbusiness more efficient through providing tools for companies to work with\neach other<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>DBE components<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Digital Business Ecosystem software comes in three parts, some of which \nare running in the background of evere DBE installation, and some that only\nsoftware developers use<\/li>\n<li>First of all, there is the Execution Environment, the heart of every DBE\ninstallation. It provides a Java Server-Client for running the installed\nDBE services<\/li>\n<li>The Execution Environment is based on the Fada network. Fada is\na scale-free Peer-to-Peer network for connecting business applications\nthat was originally developed for the tourist industry in Spain<\/li>\n<li>In addition to the Execution Environment, there is the Evolutionary\nEnvironment which provides tools for connecting different services, and \nanalyzing the health of the network<\/li>\n<li>There are grand plans for the Evolutionary Environment, including\nautomatically finding best suitable business partners and services,\nbut much of this is still experimental artificial intelligence stuff\nunder work<\/li>\n<li>For developers, there is the Service Factory, a suite of tools built\non top of the Eclipse IDE for building services and defining business\nmodels and terminologies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Business Ecosystem example<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ok, so what exactly is a business ecosystem?<\/li>\n<li>Here I'm showing a simple example of a business ecosystem: the\nconnections between a car rental company and its partners<\/li>\n<li>White lines are services offered by a business, and red lines are services \nused by a business<\/li>\n<li>The car rental company provides services like car rental and\nvalet parking to hotels<\/li>\n<li>And it consumes services like repairs from mechanics, advertising\nservices, and accounting services<\/li>\n<li>So as you can see, even a relatively simple small business\nhas connections with many different services and companies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Why do we need a Digital Ecosystem?<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>So why is DBE needed. Why do we need a digital ecosystem anyway?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Connections1<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All business is connections between people. It is connections between \ndifferent companies<\/li>\n<li>Now most of these connections happen over telephone, in meetings and\nespecially using the big business integrator: email<\/li>\n<li>Now, how many of you receive too much email?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Connections2<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>But the big issue is that business software doesn't connect. You can't\ntake your CRM system and share a client contact with your partners,\nor automatically collect bids from ten print shops in Porto Alegre for\nthese conference t-shirts<\/li>\n<li>So, you're left with browsing web sites, sending lots of email, faxes\nand making telephone calls. This is time consuming if you're trying to\nfind the best suitable partner from a collection of dozens of different\ncompanies<\/li>\n<li>DBE could help here by providing a common infrastructure for different\nbusiness applications to communicate with<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Laptop1<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the past there have been several initiatives for enabling business\nsoftware to connect. EDI, Web Services and BizTalk come to mind.<\/li>\n<li>None of these have really taken off yet. The big problem is that\nthey all rely on statically defined connections and interfaces between\ncompanies<\/li>\n<li>Static connections work well when you're doing the same, well-defined\nthings with same partners all the time over years<\/li>\n<li>But they don't work so well in a constantly changing business environment\nwhere partners and procedures and terminologies change<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Laptop2<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>However, most of the business done in the world is done by small businesses.\nThese are businesses that don't have IT departments, don't have server\ninfrastructure, and might actually be constantly on the move, changing\nfrom network to another, from supplier to another, and from business \nprocedure to another<\/li>\n<li>For them the statically defined world of Web Services isn't enough.

The talk started with a birthday greeting for <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom\">Queen Elizabeth II<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Brazil has some connections to the Maemo development, and there is quite a bit of buzz about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nokia.com\/770\">Nokia 770<\/a> here. For example, the <a href=\"http:\/\/pymaemo.sourceforge.net\/cgi-bin\/moin.cgi\/\">Python port to Maemo<\/a> was done in a Nokia-funded research center in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Recife\">Recife<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-7345abfd5b9aed4ce9e719fc0b6e67a2\/Tim_FISL_Maemo.jpg\" alt=\"Tim showing the Nokia 770\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Learning the Free Software model<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nokia.com\/\">Nokia<\/a> was a relatively late mover into the Linux space, giving them the advantage to watch how other companies were doing with their Open Source initiatives. 770 was also an excellent place to experiment with the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Free_Software\">Free Software model<\/a> of working, as it is not a mobile phone, the Nokia staple.<\/p>\n\n<p>One interesting way of working Nokia used in the Maemo project was to contract parts of the work to small consultancies abroad that were already active in their respective Open Source projects. This enabled Nokia to keep its own engineers working mainly on the device itself, and have the software infrastructure still come up.<\/p>\n\n<p>An important difference in Free Software development is that it follows a more <a href=\"http:\/\/hbswk.hbs.edu\/item.jhtml?id=2201&amp;t=technology\">evolutionary model<\/a> where different ideas are experimented with, and the strong ones survive, than the traditional <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzle.com\/editorials\/3-13-2005-67039.asp\">waterfall model<\/a> of software development. I'm not sure how much Nokia allows this evolution to happen purposefully, for example with the <a href=\"http:\/\/handhelds.org\/~philippe\/gpe-mini-browser-maemo.png\">different<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opera.com\/\">browser<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/tonikitoo.blogspot.com\/2006\/01\/just-little-taste-of-manaos-update.html\">alternatives<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Infrastructure is important<\/h2>\n\n<p>Of course, Free Software requires an infrastructure to work with. For a project, there must at least be:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A project website<\/li>\n<li>Email lists<\/li>\n<li>Version control repository<\/li>\n<li>Bug tracker<\/li>\n<li>And some kind of real-time chat<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>And all of these must be available to every potential contributor to the project. This is something where corporation-led projects like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maemo.org\/\">Maemo<\/a> still have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cgeo.net\/carlos\/blog\/?p=8\">a lot to improve<\/a>. Some of the lack of openness in the project probably comes from the initial secrecy of the Maemo project.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In the other news,<\/strong> there is a <a href=\"http:\/\/technology.guardian.co.uk\/weekly\/story\/0,,1756692,00.html\">good review of 770<\/a> on Guardian.

Therefore it is unlikely that I would be interested in a \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rice_rocket\">rice burner<\/a>\"<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Timing<\/strong>: The message arrived during the night. If I hadn't had my mobile phone on silent I might've woken up to it, which would have made me very annoyed<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Permission<\/strong>: I'm quite sure I haven't given the company permission to send me SMS messages. It is always a good idea to ask permission, as otherwise you can easily get judged to be a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spam_%28electronic%29\">spammer<\/a><\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The targeting questions are dependent on how good information about me the company has in their <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Customer_Relationship_Management\">CRM system<\/a>. The company had gotten my number during negotiations about switching my bike to a newer Triumph year ago, and so they should have information on both the city I live in, and the bike I ride.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the two other points are more inexcusable.

For that, the <a href=\"http:\/\/gnuite.com:8080\/nokia770\/maemo-mapper\/\">Maemo Mapper<\/a> is an important first piece - maps and position.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-f3172d003592d282391ecd4168e07031\/maemo-mapper.jpg\" alt=\"Navigating in Eira with Maemo Mapper\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The application is still new, and as it doesn't have any formal agreement with <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/\">Google Maps<\/a> requires a bit of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.internettablettalk.com\/forums\/showthread.php?t=1947&amp;page=1&amp;pp=10\">manual setup<\/a>, but it still is able to provide a nicer user experience than some commercial navigation packages I've seen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the next obvious thing would be to enable it to use other sources for the position information besides a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GPS\">GPS<\/a> receiver. <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.plazes.com\/api\/plazes\/\">Plazes integration<\/a> would enable users to gain their position from WiFi access points without need for additional hardware.<\/p>\n\n<p>And while we're at it, it would be very cool to be able to retrieve nearby <a href=\"http:\/\/www.placeopedia.com\/data\/\">Placeopedia spots<\/a> and populate those to the calendar. And there it would be, a device that would automatically show your position on a map and show interesting things nearby (with Wikipedia links for more info), whether or not a GPS device is available. Like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nokia.com\/770\">Nokia says<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's where you're at.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What is remarkable about this process is that Maemo Mapper happened without any knowledge or interference from Nokia (or Google I guess). This shows the power of a <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/maemo-and-free-software-innovation.html\">free development ecosystem<\/a>. I mentioned this <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the-real-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy.html\">also earlier<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now what is especially cool about the N770 and WikiPedia combination is that there is no central authority to convince to be able to build this. WikiPedia is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Copyrights\">open content<\/a>, and Nokia 770's platform is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maemo.org\/\">fully open<\/a>, meaning that anybody can just sit down and implement this.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It remains to be seen is whether Nokia and their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.internettablettalk.com\/content\/view\/175\/2\">newfound partner<\/a> Google will embrace the Hitchhiker's Guide idea and start supporting apps like Maemo Mapper.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 18:07Z:<\/strong> On a second thought, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/\">we<\/a> might be willing to sponsor Plazes integration to Nokia 770 (and Maemo Mapper) a bit.

However, the library can already be experimented with using the test tools it contains.

Let us hope the iCal implementation of it will be open as well...<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated:<\/strong> OpenPsa already includes a quite competent <a href=\"http:\/\/gforge.nehmer.net\/plugins\/scmsvn\/viewcvs.php\/trunk\/src\/org.openpsa.helpers\/vx_parser.php?rev=3799&amp;root=midcom&amp;view=markup\">vCal parser<\/a>, and using PEAR's <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/package\/HTTP_WebDAV_Server\">HTTP_WebDAV_Server<\/a> it is easy to develop DAV features so supporting CalDAV quickly should be feasible. Especially as while we wait for Leopard we can test the calendar sharing features with <a href=\"http:\/\/chandler.osafoundation.org\/\">Chandler<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 2006-08-08:<\/strong> Apple has open sourced their <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.macosforge.org\/projects\/collaboration\">CalDAV server<\/a> so this really looks like a move to the right direction.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/benefiting-from-the-glib-core\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Benefiting from the GLib core","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2006-08-12 15:24:45","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a> differs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/1.7\/architecture.html\">architecturally<\/a> quite much from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensourcecms.com\/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1\">typical open source CMSs<\/a> in that its core is written in C on top of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gtk.org\/tutorial\/c2044.html\">GLib<\/a> library.<\/p>\n\n<p>The C core means that potential users need to have <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Superuser\">superuser privileges<\/a> on their server in order to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/\">install Midgard<\/a>. This is obviously a major obstacle to people running smaller sites, but it also carries quite cool benefits, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\/pp.html\">Piotras<\/a> points our in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/people\/piotras\/magni.html\">his recent blog post<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First. Midgard core is not a CMS core, it's just database abstracion layer with authentication mechanism and some built in additional features. Thus , core is not your ideas aware. That's good , because its generic purpose doesn't limit your ideas. So together with other components ,( like midgard-apache module or midgard-php ) it turns into powerfull CMS framework which can be written in any language , like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\/\">MidCOM<\/a>  is written in PHP.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Second. Just imagine that your favourive PHP ( only PHP ) based CMS which has been developed for last three years begins to be interesting for java community. Imagine that CMS contains 50 000 lines of code. 20 000 is database releated code, another 20 000 creates logic and only 10 000 defines user interface. What java community should do in such case? Write 50 000 lines of java code and be in sync with PHP based development branch. Sounds good? No.\n  Now imagine that you want to build Your new project with python and Midgard as basement. It's enough then to write python language bindings ( which is done only once ) and focus on Your application. Amount of code which must be written depends on project only. You do not have to worry about anything else.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Now most Midgard functionality still resides in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-components\/\">PHP space<\/a>, but Java is already being used much for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/exorcist\">data migration and application integration<\/a>.

Unfortunately with such power also comes the risk of developers losing track of how much data is getting queried and used in their application.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this case I was working with a customer that has over two hundred thousand articles in their Midgard installation - the same one <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/people\/piotras\/midgard-database-indexes.html\">Piotras talked about earlier<\/a>. Midgard generally is considered as a <em>mid-range CMS<\/em>, and so most sites have a lot less data than this one, but still higher-end performance is also important.<\/p>\n\n<p>So after turning off caches and turned all the debugging output up to maximum, Piotras and I started going over the logs and finding places where queries were being duplicated needlessly. Attention quickly shifted to the usual suspects, ACL and navigational abstraction, with quite impressive results:<\/p>\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th><\/th>\n            <th colspan=\"3\">Sep 25th<\/th>\n            <th>Sep 26th<\/th>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th><\/th>\n            <th>2pm<\/th>\n            <th>5pm<\/th>\n            <th>9pm<\/th>\n            <th>4pm<\/th>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Log lines<\/th>\n            <td>12,501<\/td>\n            <td> 1,377<\/td>\n            <td>   738<\/td>\n            <td>   387<\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th>SELECTs<\/th>\n            <td>~5,000<\/td>\n            <td> 1,385<\/td>\n            <td>   642<\/td>\n            <td>   542<\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Time<\/th>\n            <td>32s<\/td>\n            <td> 3s<\/td>\n            <td> 2s<\/td>\n            <td> &lt;1s<\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n\n<p>Now, the end result of 640 queries per page view may sound like a lot, but I have to note that the particular page we're viewing includes some 150-200 content objects, each with metadata, ACLs and parameters.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a regular situation on a site of this scale we would obviously turn down the logging level, deploy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danga.com\/memcached\/\">memcached<\/a> for ACL caching, and possibly run a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.squid-cache.org\/\">Squid reverse proxy<\/a>. With those set up, Midgard really flies.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now memcached is only being used for ACL and parent hierarchy caching, but in near future we may implement also things like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-midcom-specs-subsystems-nap\/\">NAP<\/a> caching with it.<\/p>\n\n<h2>In the other news<\/h2>\n\n<p>Polish translation of MidCOM 2.6 is just off the press, courtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\/solt.html\">Solt<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-76636990c5c1958bf12d52022ee2a71a\/midcom-2.6-metadata-pl-small.jpg\" alt=\"MidCOM 2.6 metadata editor in polish\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to user interface localization, I've been working on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/development\/mrfc\/0032.html\">multilingual content in MidCOM<\/a>.

Mostly we're looking at integration points between <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/gforge.org\/\">Gforge<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doxygen\">Doxygen<\/a> to provide a complete open source project collaboration environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, as a side result Midgard also has now a new <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tag_%28metadata%29\">tagging<\/a> library: <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pear.midcom-project.org\/index.php?package=net_nemein_tag&amp;downloads\">net.nemein.tag<\/a><\/strong>. This library is aimed at centralizing how tags are handled in various <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-components\/\">MidCOM components<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Adding tagging interface is as simple as including the following into a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-2-5-datamanager-rewrite-schema-definition\/\">Datamanager 2 schema<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>'tags' =&gt; Array\n(\n    'title' =&gt; 'tags',\n    'type' =&gt; 'tags',\n    'widget' =&gt; 'text',\n),\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Tags may be entered into this field, separated by spaces. In addition to regular simple tags, like <code>midgard<\/code>, the tagging library also supports multi-word tags surrounded by quotes, like <code>\"This is a long tag\"<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another feature with tags in the concept of <strong>contexts<\/strong>. Context is something that describes the tag you apply. For example, if you are tagging a wiki page that describes a new feature in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/1.8\/\">Midgard 1.8<\/a>, you might tag it as <code>\"new-feature:Midgard 1.8\"<\/code>. This way the site builder knows more about the relation and can display it differently.<\/p>\n\n<p>Displaying tags is reasonably easy. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/net-nemein-wiki\/\">Midgard Wiki<\/a> displays tags on a page in the following way:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>\/\/ List tags used in this wiki page    \n$tags_by_context = net_nemein_tag_handler::get_object_tags_by_contexts($request_data['wikipage']);\nif (count($tags_by_context) &gt; 0)\n{\n    echo \"&lt;dl class=\\\"tags\\\"&gt;\\n\";\n    foreach ($tags_by_context as $context =&gt; $tags)\n    {\n        if (!$context)\n        {\n            $context = $_MIDCOM-&gt;i18n-&gt;get_string('tagged', 'net.nemein.tag');\n        }\n        echo \"    &lt;dt&gt;{$context}&lt;\/dt&gt;\\n\";\n        foreach ($tags as $tag =&gt; $url)\n        {\n            echo \"        &lt;dd class=\\\"tag\\\"&gt;{$tag}&lt;\/dd&gt;\\n\";\n        }\n    }\n    echo \"&lt;\/dl&gt;\\n\";\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/talk-about-response-times\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Talk about response times","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2006-10-05 21:08:11","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pear.midcom-project.org\/index.php?package=net_nemein_ping&amp;release=1.0.0&amp;downloads\">net.nemein.ping<\/a> was the original <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midcom-and-content-update-notifications.html\">experimentation ground<\/a> for MidCOM's content update notifications support.

The author wishes to remain anonymous.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I wouldn't call the referred attack cracking the passport. If you read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/idcards\/story\/0,,1950226,00.html\">the\n  specs<\/a> it's easy to see that the security measures used aren't meant to\n  deter copying the passports. The security experts are breaking through an\n  open door. (this is just my opinion, but it somewhat looks as a desperate way\n  to gather attention to themselver and not the issues) The basic access\n  control (BAC) was meant to protect against skimming (i.e. finding out\n  someones identity without their consent) and eavesdropping. It doesn't take a\n  security guru to figure out that the 35 or so bits of entropy in the\n  encryption key (document no, birthdate, expiry date) thats directly used for\n  session encryption isn't very secure against bruteforcing. Fortunately\n  eavesdropping from a distance of more than a couple of meters takes some\n  pretty complicated and bulky equipment. When fingerprints are added to\n  passports an advanced extend access control comes into use, mandating strong\n  session encryption and PKI certified passport readers. Against skimming the\n  35 bits is good enough. It's extremely unlikely that someone could get hold\n  of your passport number, expiry date and birthdate and not find out your name\n  at the same time. And if they do, there's not much else in the chip to\n  constitute a privacy risk. That said, I would still be much happier if they\n  had increased entropy by atleast 20 bits by incorporating the MRZ name line\n  in the authentication key.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>If copying is to be avoided, the spec has a provision for active\n  authentication (AA) - i.e. a private key on the chip that is verified against\n  a public key signed by document issuer. I don't know if Finland has\n  implemented active authentication in their e-passports. England and Germany\n  obvously have not, but I know for certain that Estonian e-passports will\n  contain active authentication when we're going to start issuing them in the\n  first half of next year.Even if your passport doesn't contain AA, you\n  shouldn't worry too much about cloned passports, the new passports still\n  contain other security measures so making a cloned passport is no easier now\n  than it was before e-passports. On the contrary, e-passports most likely\n  contain new revised security measures making them harder to clone.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Anyway, I'm just trying to clear up some FUD about the e-passports. Whether\n  wirelessly readable passports are useful, practical or necessary is a whole\n  another debate that I'd rather not go into. But I hope that you atleast see\n  that they're not horribly insecure.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks for the comments!

Farmers of dry areas in the state of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paran%C3%A1_%28state%29\">Paran\u00e1<\/a>, Brazil are generally relatively poor. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Petrobras\">Petrobras<\/a> has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tierramerica.net\/2003\/0526\/ianalisis.shtml\">a process<\/a> where Mamona seeds can be used to produce <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Biodiesel\">biodiesel<\/a> fuel.<\/p>\n\n<p>The IT problem related to this is that the farmers in poor areas that plant Mamona are not very well connected, and so it is difficult for Petrobras to know how many crops have been planted, and the farmers to know when and where to deliver their produce.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-5b8f258c78d611dba75a978d28b1a25aa25a\/Farm_in_Parana.jpg\" alt=\"A farm in Paran\u00e1, Brazil\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A quick solution<\/strong> would be something like the following:<\/p>\n\n<p>Petrobras could build a simple web-based database of Mamona producers, collection points and logistical companies using a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GeoCMS\">Geospatial Content Management System<\/a> like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>. Here farmers would be guided through a process of registering their farm, positioning it on a Google Map, and reporting the number of their planted crops.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since the farmers do not have IT infrastructure available, Petrobras could distribute a set of <a href=\"http:\/\/europe.nokia.com\/770\">Nokia 770<\/a> Internet Tablets and GPRS-enabled cell phones for them. Compared to a regular PC, the 770 has advantages of relatively low cost, low power consumption, support for using cell phone network for connectivity and support for any regular Nokia phone charger, including <a href=\"http:\/\/store.sundancesolar.com\/mi3sochforce.html\">solar<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Campo-Crank-Flashlight-Phone-Charger\/dp\/B000FRZ8XM\">hand cranked chargers<\/a>.

This information would be produced as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.georss.org\/\">GeoRSS<\/a> feed to the logistical companies whose 770s could automatically find loads to pick up from their vicinity. The feed would contain the farmer's contact information so that they could contact the farmer, and since it is geotagged would also automatically appear as a <a href=\"http:\/\/eko.one.pl\/index.php?page=Nokia770_software#Screenshot\">Point of Interest<\/a> in the <a href=\"http:\/\/gnuite.com:8080\/nokia770\/maemo-mapper\/\">770 map application<\/a>.

Before I go to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Saint_Petersburg\">Saint Petersburg<\/a> for the new year celebrations I wanted to write something about how I see 2007 for the Midgard CMS project.<\/p>\n\n<p>Software-wise, <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/happy-new-year--and-a-look-back-at-2005.html\">2005<\/a> and 2006 have been good years for Midgard. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\/\">MidCOM<\/a> established itself as the default way of building things and became a lot faster and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/content-production-with-midcom\/\">user-friendly<\/a>. Developers got cool new tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgardquerybuilder\/\">Query Builder<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php-midgard_collector\/\">Collector<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema\/\">MgdSchema<\/a>. We also integrated with external packages like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/setting-up-squid-reverse-proxy\/\">Squid<\/a> for content caching, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-services-indexer-installation\/\">Lucene<\/a> for full-text search and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/version2\/documentation\/funambol-syncml-setup\/\">Funambol<\/a> for mobile device synchronization. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.georss.org\/blog\/?p=44\">Geographic awareness<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/microformat-usage-in-midcom\/\">Microformats integration<\/a> also add interesting possibilities to the system.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, community-wise I feel we also lost something. These new functionalities have mostly been gained at the expense of the installation becoming more difficult and the system harder to understand. And as the learning curve becomes steeper, new users and developers <a href=\"http:\/\/desdeamericaconamor.org\/blog\/node\/309\">may pick<\/a> some less powerful CMS instead of Midgard as their choice.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 2007 I think we should focus on this problem: <strong>Making Midgard more accessible to the normal web developer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, there are four areas to put effort into:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Installation.<\/strong> This is the part where we can make most impact. Currently Midgard installation is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/\">difficult process<\/a> that takes a lot of time even from a seasoned user of the software.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we want to make it more \"<em>just running <code>apt-get<\/code><\/em>\", we must rethink the whole database and site initialization concept. Datagard must go and be replaced with a PHP-CLI tool that is smart enough to probe and guess most details, and which will not only generate required configuration files, but also populate all data needed into the database.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now Midgard's default install is geared for setting up a hosting server, and I believe this to be a faulty assumption. Instead of focusing on hosting setups as the easiest and initial install we should focus on single-organization setups. This means creating a sitegroup and an initial site there automatically instead of creating a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgard-admin-sitewizard\/\">Site Wizard<\/a> host.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Templating.<\/strong> Midgard has a very powerful site templating system, but it is very difficult to understand for new people. Element inheritance, style inheritance, <code>style-init<\/code> elements, semiautomatic substyling, manual substyling and other concepts are difficult to \"get\". Similarly, the default contents of an element are difficult to get to.<\/p>\n\n<p>To expose the full power of the templating system to developers we need to write a new kind of style editor for Midgard. The new style editor must work within the site context and tell the site builder what elements are available for customization and where.<\/p>\n\n<p>Arttu already did some sketches for this new editor, so this might actually be reasonably quick to implement.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once editing of style templates has been made easier, the next thing to expose to our users should be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/creating-midcom-helper-datamanager-schemas\/\">Datamanager schemas<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Demo.<\/strong> While Midgard will never be featured on demo sites like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensourcecms.com\/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=503&amp;Itemid=191\">OpenSourceCMS<\/a>, we would be able to run our own demo setup quite easily. A company like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/\">Nemein<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anykey.se\/\">Anykey<\/a> could donate the needed server resources and we could set up a system where people could gain access to a Midgard setup that would be automatically cleaned at some interval.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the replication system in Midgard matures we could even allow people to start building their site at the demo server and then copy the contents to their own install if they like the system.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Community resources.<\/strong> Now there is a serious disconnect between the community resources used by various Midgard subprojects. Midgard and Aegir use CVS while MidCOM uses Subversion. Midgard uses web-based forums while MidCOM has a mailing list. And bug tracking is spread all over Tigris and Gforge.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is another thing we must consolidate in 2007, especially since <a href=\"http:\/\/keithp.com\/blog\/Repository_Formats_Matter.html\">repository formats matter<\/a>. So far I see three options:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Consolidating everything into Gforge and taking benefit of the <a href=\"https:\/\/garage.maemo.org\/docman\/view.php\/106\/45\/Maemo_Midgard_Migration_Project_Feasibility_Study.pdf\">Midgard-Gforge integration<\/a> we've done for Maemo<\/li>\n<li>Entering <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/\">Apache Incubator<\/a> and utilizing their project infrastructure<\/li>\n<li>Switching to a centralized SVN repository and possibly <a href=\"https:\/\/help.launchpad.net\/BugTrackingHighlights\">Launchpad<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/events\/midgard-developer-meeting.html\">Midgard developer meeting<\/a> in Sweden on January 19th - 21st will provide a good chance to discuss and work on these.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/tank-surfing-on-flickr\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Tank surfing on Flickr","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2006-12-30 07:10:16","atom:content":"<p>This picture from the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard-developer-meeting-in-komorniki.html\">Midgard developer meeting trip<\/a> to Komorniki, Poland was chosen as one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/groups\/tanktanks\/discuss\/72157594446946126\/\">top tank pictures<\/a> of the year in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/\">Flickr<\/a>.

First replication was handled with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-repligard\/\">Repligard<\/a> command-line tool. Then in 2005 we got the Java-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/exorcist\/\">Exorcist<\/a> tool that was able to do cross-CMS replication. But both of them suffered from being slightly external of the normal Midgard environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>With Midgard 1.8.1 there is now an integrated Midgard Replicator system that provides replication API on both <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midgard\/core\/1.8\/modules.html\">C<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php-midgard_replicator\/\">PHP levels<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To support that we've now been working on a midcom.helper.replicator library that handles the issues of solving what to replicate, where and how. The library has been made with a modular toolbox philosophy where each replication pipeline is stored as a \"subscription\" that defines what exporter, transporter and importer should be used.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some example cases here:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Staging\/live:<\/strong> the subscription is configured to use an exporter that checks for object approval before exporting, and a transporter that directly sends the data to the live server via HTTP<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Automatic backups:<\/strong> you can create a replication subscription that will send all database changes as XML packages to your Gmail account for free off-site backup<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Collaboration on specific items:<\/strong> we could define a \"wiki collaboration\" exporter that you could use to exchange wiki pages between other project parters<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now the export and transport ends are mostly done and we're today focusing on integrating the importers with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-dba\/\">MidCOM DBA<\/a> layer to get the benefit of watchers, ACLs and other checks in the import end.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'll update this post with more details as we go.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Random thought: Midgard vs. Drupal communities<\/h2>\n\n<p>Looking at <a href=\"http:\/\/ohloh.net\/\">Ohloh<\/a> statistics, <a href=\"http:\/\/ohloh.net\/projects\/3309\">Midgard has had 38 contributors<\/a> since 2001 when we switched repositories, while <a href=\"http:\/\/ohloh.net\/projects\/3502\">Drupal has had 589 contributors<\/a>. With this huge disparity of numbers it is a bit difficult to understand how Midgard has 207 person years behind it, while Drupal only has had 113. Midgard also has a lot more code. I guess Midgard contributors just are more productive.

The reason for this is simple:<\/p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/tools\/\">dozens of tools<\/a> that can upload to Flickr easily, including <a href=\"http:\/\/connectedflow.com\/flickrexport\/iphoto\/\">FlickrExport for iPhoto<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/r2.nokia.com\/nokia\/0,,71739,00.html\">Nokia Lifeblog<\/a>, but very few tools that could do the same for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>. By centralizing to Flickr I make my life a lot easier, but also lock myself to a proprietary service.<\/p>\n\n<p>Luckily Flickr has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/services\/api\/\">quite comprehensive API<\/a> for photo management. By using the nice <a href=\"http:\/\/phpflickr.com\/\">phpFlickr library<\/a> I am able to synchronize the photos uploaded to Flickr to my blog.

Here are the first photos imported:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-b6ce1950b6e111db90a379a48fc801d301d3\/photostream-flickr-import-latest.jpg\" height=\"272\" width=\"336\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Photostream-Flickr-Import-Latest\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The way this works is that I've subscribed my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-components\/\">org.routamc.photostream<\/a> installation to my Flickr account. By default it checks every hour whether there are new photos, but I can also do a manual synchronization:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-b2232878b6e111db979c57a68e43bcd1bcd1\/photostream-flickr-import-raw.jpg\" height=\"169\" width=\"336\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Photostream-Flickr-Import-Raw\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>This functionality is available in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/running-latest-midcom-from-subversion\/\">MidCOM SVN trunk<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In related news<\/strong>, thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.plazes.com\/raffle\/\">Plazes raffle<\/a> last year, I now have two more years of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/upgrade\/\">Flickr pro account<\/a> available.

This means your content can also be secure in a server you control.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can connect the data from different services together and enrich it with data produced with Midgard's own components. Consider for example having the following play nicely together:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blog entries coming from an external blog service or Midgard itself<\/li>\n<li>Bookmarks coming from del.icio.us<\/li>\n<li>Photos coming from Flickr<\/li>\n<li>Videos coming from Youtube<\/li>\n<li>Status messages coming from Twitter<\/li>\n<li>...all connected with geolocation data coming from Plazes and shared via RSS feeds and Microformats<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In this session we look at how such a personal information space can be set up with Midgard, and how new functionalities or data connections can be developed for it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This is somewhat related to the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/synchronization-and-the-free-software-desktop-in-guadec.html\">Feeds, Synchronization and the Free Software Desktop<\/a> session we held with <a href=\"http:\/\/tigert.com\/\">Tigert<\/a> in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/bergie\/feeds-synchronization-and-the-free-software-desktop\/\">GUADEC last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in the idea, please <a href=\"http:\/\/2007.oscms-summit.org\/node\/181\">go and vote for the session<\/a>.

Well yeah, we've been watching them very closely too, and by \"we've\" I mean a few of us here in the office that care very much about these things, Aaron probably more than most of us.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The first application for machine tags is geotagging. We were discussing the problem of geotagging entries by email with <a href=\"http:\/\/highearthorbit.com\/\">Andrew Turner<\/a> and trying to come up with a solution that would work in both Midgard and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.georss.org\/geopress\/\">GeoPress<\/a>. The decision was to support the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/help\/photos\/#140\">Flickr email-based tagging format<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that to geotag a blog entry, just include the following to the end of email body:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>tags: geo:long=24.9419260025024 geo:lat=60.1587851399795\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Tools like Flickr email import, Geopress and Midgard will be able to parse this information and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the-midgard-position.html\">position your blog entry<\/a> accordingly, on both <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/wiki\/geo\">site<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/georss.org\/\">GeoRSS feeds<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, the same format can be used for regular tagging:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>tags: waterpipe n800 canola sabrage\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h2>Machine tags as a record extension<\/h2>\n\n<p>Now that machine tags are in, pulling information from them is quite easy. Here's an example using the <code>camel:size=medium<\/code> tag from <a href=\"http:\/\/geobloggers.com\/archives\/2007\/01\/24\/offtopic-ish-flickr-ramps-up-triple-tag-support\/\">Dan Catt's post<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\/\/ Load a camel photo\n$photo = new org_routamc_photostream_photo_dba('GUID');\n\n\/\/ Load camel-related data from the tags\n$data = net_nemein_tag_handler::get_object_machine_tags_in_context($photo, 'camel');\n\n\/\/ Show the data\necho \"{$photo-&gt;title} is a {$data['size']} sized camel.\";\n?&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>As is visible from this example, machine tags can be used in a bit similar way as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference-parameter\/\">parameters<\/a> are used in the Midgard world. The advantage machine tags have however is that they are compatible with any system that supports tagging.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated:<\/strong> There is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.machinetags.org\/wiki\/Main_Page\">even a wiki<\/a> for formalizing <a href=\"http:\/\/ebiquity.umbc.edu\/blogger\/2007\/01\/28\/rise-of-the-machine-tags\/\">machine tagging conventions<\/a>.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/geoclue_and_maemo_plazer\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"GeoClue and Maemo Plazer","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2007-03-02 01:03:12","atom:content":"<p>We had another <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/plazes_on_the_n800.html\">Maemo hacking night<\/a> here at the office.

While so far the music library Kerttu and I have accumulated has been perfectly enough for me, I decided to give Rhapsody a shot.<\/p>\n\n<p>Installation on N800 was not very easy as the download link provided in <a href=\"http:\/\/tableteer.nokia.com\/\">Nokia's Tableteer site<\/a> didn't work. However, I was able to find the <a href=\"http:\/\/catalogue.tableteer.nokia.com\/certified\/pool\/bora\/user\/r\/rhapsody\/\">direct download URL<\/a> and so install the application. This will hopefully be fixed by Nokia soon.<\/p>\n\n<p>In any case, when installed Rhapsody populates an icon to the Maemo menu (by default to \"Favorites\" but this can be changed). Clicking it launches the application in full-screen state, a bit like <a href=\"http:\/\/downloads.maemo.org\/product\/canola\/\">Canola<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-5e08175edc9c11dbaf5507d659795b685b68\/rhapsody-n800.jpg\" height=\"240\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Rhapsody-N800\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>When launched, I was asked whether I already had <a href=\"http:\/\/learn.rhapsody.com\/plans?pageid=unagi.11894418.wrapper&amp;pageregion=A1&amp;src=rotw.learn_overview&amp;pcode=rn&amp;opage=rotw.learn_overview\">a Rhapsody account<\/a>, or whether I wanted to try a 30 day trial. I opted for the trial since I don't know if Rhapsody will be useful for me or not.<\/p>\n\n<p>The application is split into three panels, two of which fit into screen at same time. The left-most is the music searching and browsing view that uses a kind of tree system for displaying different selections. The middle panel is the current playlist, and the right-most panel displays currently playing song. The panels can be navigated using the big \"Now playing\" and \"Library\" buttons between them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Music could be searched by artist, album or track. On a quick search I noticed the song selection to be wide but very US-centric. However, as a pleasant point for anybody using the thumb keyboard, the search seemed quite good at catching typos and providing \"did you mean... ?\" results.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clicking a search result takes you to the artist's \"folder\" where you have options like All albums, Top tracks and Samples. Unfortunately these don't necessarily contain any results. It would be a lot nicer if options that don't lead anywhere were greyed out for example. This is especially problematic as the UI seems to be a bit unresponsive at places.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clicking a song adds it to the playlist, which may be arranged using the arrow buttons in the bottom of the screen. The client for Nokia seems to support only streaming, which mostly works quite well but was breaking a bit in my tests.<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on these quick tests, I don't think I'm ready to pay the 10$ or 15$ per month for the service. Rhapsody contains a lot of music, but most of it is not very relevant for me. And being able to play the music only when I have a good internet connection is not that appealing either. But we'll have to see.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated:<\/strong> I kind of understand why such proprietary content distribution system has to be closed source, but it should be a <a href=\"https:\/\/garage.maemo.org\/tracker\/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=213&amp;group_id=125&amp;atid=532\">Canola backend<\/a> instead of providing its own, slightly weird UI.

Which is bizarre when you look at how availability of connectivity is ever increasing. EVDO cards, city-wide wifis, iPhones, Blackberry\u2019s. There are so many ways to get online these days that the excitement for offline is truly puzzling. Until you consider the one place that is still largely an island of missing connectivity: The plane!<\/p>\n  \n  <p>But planes are not a very common hang-out spot for most people. The two major groups of people who are on a plane often enough to care and have an interest in web applications are traveling salesmen and techies who go to too many conferences.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As some commenter already noted in that blog post, this is all good and well until you try to work abroad and get charged exorbitant roaming charges, or do work anywhere outside the western world. It is also sometimes nice to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/finding-resources-automatically-in-openpsa.html\">purposefully go to some remote location<\/a> where one can work without any of the interruptions and procrastination excuses a working internet connection automatically brings.<\/p>\n\n<p>These situations are why I still think the idea of offline applications is a good one, as long as making them doesn't unnecessarily complicate application development. Doing it on the Ajax layer is one option.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another option is synchronization, like popularized in the <a href=\"http:\/\/beech.vcu.edu\/lspace\/notesr5\/mcenter.nsf\/8214739e835361d18525630600486645\/852567e200589e568525679e004d2a9d?OpenDocument\">Lotus Notes replication feature<\/a>. With synchronization, the application always uses a local data repository, and a separate tool keeps moving data back and forth with a central server whenever user has a connection available (or specifically requests it).<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a standardized synchronization protocol available: Open Mobile Alliance's <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SyncML\">Data Synchronization (OMA DS)<\/a>, which was formerly known as SyncML. However, implementing it is fairly difficult without a <a href=\"http:\/\/www-128.ibm.com\/developerworks\/xml\/library\/x-syncml3.html\">SyncML toolkit<\/a> like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.funambol.com\/opensource\/\">Funambol<\/a>. Because of this, other protocols like <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol\">IMAP<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/WebDAV\">WebDAV<\/a> are also sometimes used.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard's<\/a> approach to synchronized setups is to provide strong <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php-midgard_replicator\/\">data import and export<\/a> capabilities on the framework level and then allow the actual replication tools to be written on application level. <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard-replication-service-starts-to-shape-up.html\">The current implementation<\/a> includes data synchronization via HTTP and email implemented in PHP. Something like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensync.org\/\">OpenSync<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.conduit-project.org\/\">Conduit<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.funambol.com\/opensource\/\">Funambol<\/a> would probably make sense later, especially if Midgard starts to become more of a replicated persistent storage system for desktop applications as I predicted in <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard-managing_free_software_project_as_a_joint_venture.html\">my presentation in Kristiansand<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Offline data access is especially important for mobile devices, which is why I find it very inconvenient that most applications for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nokiausa.com\/N800\/1,9008,,00.html\">Nokia's N800 tablet<\/a> assume an always-connected model. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/downloads.maemo.org\/product\/canola\/\">Canola<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/garage.maemo.org\/tracker\/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=229&amp;group_id=125&amp;atid=532\">doesn't cache podcasts locally<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2007\/03\/27\/nokia-and-real-adda-rhapsody-to-the-n800\/\">Rhapsody<\/a> music is <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/first_look_at_rhapsody_for_n800.html\">only available when online<\/a>. Similarly, there still isn't a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.internettablettalk.com\/forums\/showthread.php?t=4793\">proper offline RSS reading capability<\/a>. I was using <a href=\"http:\/\/downloads.maemo.org\/product\/maemo-mapper\/\">Maemo Mapper<\/a> for navigation when driving to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/sets\/72157600010088557\/\">Utsjoki hunting trip<\/a>, and quite often map downloads failed because GPRS\/3G connection broke somewhere in the countryside.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in my view offline capability is still very important for any application that is useful when traveling. Internet access may be quite well available inside cities, but still in countryside or in tunnels connection can be really bad. If development tools like Midgard make building offline functionality into apps easier this will hopefully become more common.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_weekly_summary-71-april_5th_2007\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Midgard Weekly Summary #71: April 5th 2007","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2007-04-05 16:08:09","atom:content":"<ul>\n<li><p>Midgard developer meeting on June 1st - 3rd. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/events\/midgard_developer_meeting.html\">The next Midgard developer meeting<\/a> will be held in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hut.fi\/\">Helsinki University of Technology<\/a> campus.

I'm interested in sharing state with a small group I'm nearly always in contact with, what Mimi Ito has called full-time intimate community.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mobile sociality<\/strong> - Jaiku was designed with the mobile \"living phonebook\" interface in mind. SMS alerts crowding the inbox of one of the few working personal and functional communication channels is not my idea of improving communication.

And all of these have different user interfaces and different usage logic.<\/p>\n\n<p>This kind of long-distance journey planning is something car navigation software has been good at for a long time. If I want to drive from Stockholm to an address in Milan, I just enter the end points and the navigation software calculates me a proper route. Sometimes the <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.outer-court.com\/archive\/2007-03-29-n17.html\">results can be funny<\/a> but generally this approach works for drivers, especially to ones with GPS navigators.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-87c262c4137011dcb3412df2224af915f915\/curitiba-public-transport-system.jpg\" height=\"258\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Curitiba-Public-Transport-System\" title=\"curitiba-public-transport-system.png\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/transit\">Google Transit<\/a> is trying to fulfill the need for a common public transport route planner that would work between different cities and countries, but so far<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en_ALL\/help\/faq_transit.html#what_cities_are_included\"> very few places<\/a> are in it. This is probably mainly a political issue, as <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/transit\/spec\/transit_feed_specification.htm#Google_Transit_Feed_Field_Definitions\">Google's format<\/a> should be reasonably easy to support for any city transport system that is reasonably computerized or reliable.<\/p>\n\n<p>While providing the data to Google would be a great first step for a centralized route planning system, I'd like to advocate for governments to take a step further: provide the data in an open format to some public entity. For example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geonames.org\/\">Geonames<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/index.php\">Internet Archive<\/a> could work as the central public transport data repository usable by any software developer.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-84e58e8c137011dca9b6078f07d720a520a5\/helsinki-koff-pub-tram.jpg\" height=\"213\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Helsinki-Koff-Pub-Tram\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>This would enable competition between journey planners, <a href=\"http:\/\/worrydream.com\/MagicInk\/#case_study_train_schedules\">innovative user interface development<\/a>, and bringing the data to mobile devices like phones or <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/\">internet tablets<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I believe Finland, with its reasonably<a href=\"http:\/\/www.visitfinland.com\/w5\/index.nsf\/(pages)\/Public_Transportation\"> good public transport system<\/a>, should take initiative in this. If the nation-wide public transport route information was available to software developers, an enormous amount of competence in this would arise and be ready to enter international markets when other countries follow suit in opening their data. In addition to national software economy, this would also boost tourism by making the country easier to travel in.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 20:05Z<\/strong>: I was informed on <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/community\/irc.html\">#maemo<\/a> that such centralized route planner has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mintc.fi\/scripts\/cgiip.exe\/WService=lvm\/cm\/pub\/showdoc.p?docid=2392&amp;menuid=401\">recently been released<\/a> for Finland: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.matka.fi\/en\/\">matka.fi<\/a> allows Reittiopas-like routing with public transport in the whole country. The database doesn't seem to be fully complete, yet, and so sometimes it suggests quite long walks or taking a cab.

The plan was to first ride to Switzerland to attend the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/european_haidong_gumdo_championships_in_zurich_mid-june.html\">first Haidong Gumdo European Championships<\/a>, and then continue from there together with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/427380213\/in\/set-72157600010088557\/\">Juha<\/a> to Montenegro. As it happens, Juha never got his motorcycle working, and my trip was filled with various adventures and misfortune, but also with friendly people and beautiful scenery.<\/p>\n\n<p>I left Helsinki on June 9th, heading south following the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Via_Baltica\">Via Baltica<\/a>. My first stop was to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lodz\">Lodz<\/a> to meet <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/540562377\/in\/set-72157600619719885\/\">Piotras<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> core guy. From there I followed the nice, curvy country roads of Poland to see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/321597731\/\">Natka<\/a> and her new country-house near <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jelenia_Gora\">Jelenia Gora<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-73c7221e2a7c11dc8ebbfb2fc8e16ec96ec9\/in_pokrzywnik.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"In Pokrzywnik\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I lost the sense of what bike I was riding, resulting to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.jaiku.com\/presence\/4172546\">a tumble<\/a> in a dark, tight corner. So, the next day was spent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/542173249\/in\/set-72157600619719885\/\">repairing the bike<\/a> and getting my arm x-rayed.<\/p>\n\n<p>From Silesia my trip took me to Czech Republic, and I stopped for the night in the city of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Karlovy_Vary\">Karlovy Vary<\/a>, destined to be the site of the worst adventure of the trip. I went out for dinner, after which I ran into a local girl who invited me to join her for a drink. Soon we were joined by another local woman. After some chat with them, and a couple of drinks, I suddenly lost consciousness.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next thing I realized was that I woke up in hospital, filled with plugs and pipes, cell phone and Nokia 770 stolen and with no idea of what had happened. Apparently my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesscrimedirect.org.uk\/page.asp?pagekey=183\">drink had been spiked<\/a>. I was struck with paranoia and just wanted out and away. The staff didn't speak English, but after some attempts I was able to convince them in a combination of German and Russian to let me leave. Once out, I took off towards the border as quickly as I could.<\/p>\n\n<p>In Switzerland I was able to get a new cell phone, and got a rather unpleasant call from my credit card company: the thieves had withdrawn 9,900 EUR (about 13,500 USD) from my card, and the company wanted the money back. I'm still wondering what to do about this, as insurance doesn't protect from it.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-952fb1e62a7c11dc98b65baba0fc0b4c0b4c\/hdgd_championships_swiss_sworddancing.jpg\" height=\"257\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Hdgd Championships Swiss Sworddancing\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.euhaidong.com\/\">Haidong Gumdo<\/a> championships themselves were a well organized and nice event. While my personal performance was hindered by the aftereffects of the drugging and lack of practice on the trip, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phoenixmartialart.fi\/ajankohtaista\/view\/em2007.html\">Team Finland<\/a> brought home <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/559827993\/in\/set-72157600619719885\/\">two medals<\/a> and we had a lot of good time meeting Haidong Gumdo practitioners from other countries. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swissbudo-portal.ch\/wPortal\/aktuelles\/meldungen\/2007_06_18_34149231_meldung.php?navid=9\">Night of the Sword gala<\/a> contained some of the most amazing swordsmanship I've ever seen, although <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=89qnnKy26xE\">the video<\/a> doesn't do it full justice.<\/p>\n\n<p>After the competition I stayed at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/567862216\/in\/set-72157600619719885\/\">Michi's<\/a> place, chatting about various things and getting some encouragement to continue the trip despite the catastrophic drink-spiking incident that had left me without credit cards and feeling physically very weak. At this point it became apparent Juha wouldn't be able to join me, so I switched Montenegro for riding back home via Hungary and Romania.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next two days were pleasant riding in the Alps. Old towns and castles, mountains and curving passes.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-92d2345a2a7c11dc8c5aa7a284955a2d5a2d\/enfield_lake_brienz.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"18062007075.jpg\" title=\"18062007075.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>But after visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neuschwanstein\">Neuschwanstein<\/a> castle, misfortune again caught up with me, this time in form of an engine failure. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/589538974\/in\/set-72157600619719885\/\">valve seat<\/a> had became loose, making piston and exhaust valve collide. This obviously required new parts, leaving me looking for <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royal_Enfield\">Enfield<\/a> shops in Bavaria. With the help of my \"<a href=\"http:\/\/rambo.pbt-unknown.org\/blog\/\">ground staff<\/a>\", I got the bike towed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iwan-bikes.de\/\">Iwan-Bikes<\/a>, the Enfield dealer near Munich. They had the parts needed, but not the time so we made the deal that I would disassemble the cylinder head, and they would change the parts and put the bike back together. Two days after the engine failure I was back on the road, riding in Austria.<\/p>\n\n<p>After <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cctv.com\/english\/20070622\/108426.shtml\">rainy and a bit cold Austria<\/a>, entering sunny Hungary was a pleasure. I stayed with <a href=\"http:\/\/ferenc.jaiku.com\/\">Ferenc's<\/a> family at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lake_Balaton\">lake Balaton<\/a>, enjoying swimming, local cuisine and home-grown wine.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-8d5ffdea2a7c11dc8ebbfb2fc8e16ec96ec9\/bergie_resting_at_lake_balaton-1.jpg\" height=\"198\" width=\"398\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Bergie Resting At Lake Balaton-1\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Romania showed itself to be quite a contrast to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great_Hungarian_Plain\">Hungarian plain<\/a>. Coming from a hot, flat land, I was suddenly again riding <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carpathian_Mountains\">in mountains<\/a>. A fascinating country where almost half of the traffic consisted of horse carriages. In the border town of Suceava I felt a bit torn: whether to head home, or make a detour through <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moldova\">Moldova<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transnistria\">Transnistria<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Odessa\">Odessa<\/a>. Following the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moviemartyr.com\/1992\/crimsonpig.htm\">old guideline<\/a> of <em>\"<\/em><em>A pig who doesn\u2019t fly is just an ordinary pig\"<\/em>, the decision was easy. But again fate took part in the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was riding in the borderlands between Romania and Moldova when the engine decided to stop again. Luckily <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/632661878\/in\/set-72157600619719885\/\">a border patrol<\/a> was close and helped me to get the bike towed to nearest city, which in this case happened to be <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ia%C5%9Fi\">Iasi<\/a>. After a night in one-star hotel I limped the bike to nearest car repair shop. They didn't understand much about bikes there, but the shop's owner was very friendly and helpful. Some phone calls were made, and soon I was in a motorcycle repair shop explaining the problem.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-8b6280582a7c11dc8c5aa7a284955a2d5a2d\/enfield_in_carpathian_mountains.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"26062007134.jpg\" title=\"26062007134.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The guys started working on the bike immediately, and after couple hours said I could ride. I thanked them, packed the bike and headed west through the city. But in two kilometers the engine failed again, and I limped back to the garage. A new repair attempt was made, more successfully this time, but as it was already late the guys invited me to stay with them and to go to a gathering of local bikers.<\/p>\n\n<p>I spent the night drinking and chatting with the group, and in the morning left with the bike towards Ukraine, the rest of the trip going without incident. I visited <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lviv\">Lviv<\/a>, a city I had seen the last time <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/weekend_in_ukraine.html\">during the Orange Revolution<\/a>, and then crossed to the Polish side of the border.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-88804e382a7c11dcb4ac6dc4822a33c333c3\/riding_to_sunset_in_ukraine.jpg\" height=\"175\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Riding To Sunset In Ukraine\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Riding in Poland already felt almost like home, and soon I was back on the familiar Via Baltica, taking me through Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to the port of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tallinn\">Tallinn<\/a>, and on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tallinksilja.com\/fi\/tab2\/ships\/star\/default.htm\">a ferry<\/a> to home.

This functionality depended on the <a href=\"http:\/\/pecl.php.net\/package\/translit\">PECL translit extension<\/a> which, in our tests, proved to be troublesome with some languages.<\/p>\n\n<p>After a bit of googling we ran into the <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/phputf8\/\">PHP UTF-8 project<\/a>, and more specifically to its <a href=\"http:\/\/phputf8.cvs.sourceforge.net\/phputf8\/utf8_to_ascii\/README?view=markup\">utf8_to_ascii<\/a> tool that is a PHP port of the <a href=\"http:\/\/interglacial.com\/~sburke\/tpj\/as_html\/tpj22.html\">Perl Unidecode<\/a> package. This library was small enough to be bundled into MidCOM itself, removing the dependency of an additional PHP extension, and seemed to cope with various languages much better.<\/p>\n\n<p>The results were not perfect, of course, but at least West European and Scandinavian languages, Russian, Polish, Greek, Maori and Amharic worked perfectly. Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Korean, Thai and Viet produced results that were possibly correct. Japanese (hiragana and katagana), Devanagari and Georgian did not work at all. A good start nevertheless.

Most map data is currently closed and controlled by various organizations under copyright, making it unavailable or prohibitively expensive for open source or experimentative use. An open map can be used anywhere and kept up-to-date with the changing landscape quite easily.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to creating street maps, OpenStreetMap, being <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/Foundation\">a noncommercial entity<\/a> can also map things that most commercial navigation companies are not interested in: many OSM contributors are focusing on mapping <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/Map_Features#Cycleway\">cycle<\/a> or hiking routes and <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/Map_Features#Waterway\">waterways<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.free-map.org.uk\/\">Free-maps<\/a> is a site that even provides a hiking-oriented rendering of the OSM data overlaid with <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.jpl.nasa.gov\/srtm\/\">SRTM<\/a> contours and elevation data from NASA. Something similar would be easy to do for motorcyclists, highlighting scenic areas and twisties.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Creating the map<\/h2>\n\n<p>What surprised me about OSM is how well the project is actually progressing. In the three years the project has been running, the number of contributors has risen on the same scale as Wikipedia in its first years. Here are some status reports of various countries:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>United Kingdom<\/strong> is now at estimated 50% completeness, and the project has the target of finishing the country by mid-2008<\/li>\n<li><strong>Spain<\/strong> has been starting a bit slowly, but IGN, the national mapping agency recently announced support for the project which should bring the country to completeness quite soon<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Netherlands<\/strong> was boosted greatly by a Digital Pioneers grant to buy GPS units and arrange mapping parties, and now the main cities are quite complete. In addition, AND has donated complete map data for the country which will be imported to OSM soon<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bolivia<\/strong> has no national mapping agency and so is considering to use OSM as the authoritative map source used for elections<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-c3fe1c3a32ea11dca81aa3e5def917a917a9\/openstreetmap-amsterdam-20070715.png\" height=\"266\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Openstreetmap-Amsterdam-20070715\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Finland<\/strong>, unfortunately, is <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/WikiProject_Finland\">in a very early stage<\/a>. Some of central Helsinki, and some main roads there, but most of the country is still <em>Here be dragons<\/em> territory. More publicity and some support could however boost this quickly. As an example, The Netherlands was still in the same stage four months ago.<\/p>\n\n<h2>OSM on mobile devices<\/h2>\n\n<p>We <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/chrisfleming\/822333479\/in\/photostream\/\">held a speech<\/a> together with Andrew Turner of <a href=\"http:\/\/highearthorbit.com\/\">High Earth Orbit<\/a> about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Software\/GeoClue\/\">GeoClue<\/a> and position-aware services on mobile Linux devices. Linux devices like N800 and Neo1973 are available now, and GPSs are appearing more and more mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n<p>But what is largely missing is position-aware services for them. Of course, most of them can browse maps with tile-based tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/maemo_mapper-openstreetmap_and_wikipedia.html\">Maemo Mapper<\/a>. But where things will get interesting is when the publicly-available geodata and the position of the device are brought together to enrich various applications and services on the device.<\/p>\n\n<p>The GeoClue project was started in order to make position information easily available for application authors. A simple <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/D-BUS\">D-BUS<\/a> query, and the application can get the location of the device regardless of whether it comes from GPS, Plazes or some other service.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-c1c89b2032ea11dc873421b723bf76537653\/geoclue-architecture.jpg\" height=\"297\" width=\"260\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Geoclue-Architecture\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>KDE has also been working on some location-based tools and services for their desktop, built around the Marble map viewer. Hopefully we can share the efforts in the freedesktop community.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Route planning with OSM<\/h2>\n\n<p>In addition to being community-created and open, the OSM map data has one huge advantage towards using Google Maps and the like: it is vectors with proper metadata instead of just map tiles.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/Planet.osm\">OSM data can be downloaded<\/a> to a device and used for route planning. <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/Gosmore\">Gosmore<\/a> is the first project that appeared to this space.<\/p>\n\n<p>Routing with the data is reasonably easy by ditching data that is not relevant to routing (like buildings), and then running through the street network with either <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm\">Dijkstra<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A%2A_search_algorithm\">A*<\/a> algorithm, giving \"distance penalties\" for road segments depending on their type and speed limit.<\/p>\n\n<p>A project in Norway had improved on this by implementing the concept of evaluations of road segments by special interest groups. For example, wheelchair users could evaluate roads on their suitability for travel by wheelchair, and then future routes of all wheelchair users would take these into account.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Maemo Surveyor<\/h2>\n\n<p>With current surveying tools and editors <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/Mapping_techniques\">creating OpenStreetMaps<\/a> is quite slow, especially for <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openstreetmap.org\/index.php\/Beginners%27_Guide\">new contributors<\/a>. An estimate was made that per each urban community of 1000 inhabitants, an hour of surveying and hour of tagging would be needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>This statistic brought some discussion of having better tools for map-making. Our take on that would be the idea of a <em>Maemo Surveyor<\/em>, a mobile application recording the GPS tracks and enabling the user to tag them with road types and provide either a typed name, a voice note or a photo of the road sign.<\/p>\n\n<p>The application would keep this in the OSM XML format to enable things like live Mapnik rendering in the future and make it easy to upload the data directly to OSM.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-c0b2227432ea11dc873421b723bf76537653\/maemo-surveyor-sketch.jpg\" height=\"196\" width=\"400\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Maemo-Surveyor-Sketch\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Now the app is just in mockup format but I believe it should be quite easy to implement with Glade, Python and GeoClue.<\/p>\n\n<p>After our talk I got some interesting comments and ideas for the Surveyor application. A research group in Norway is thinking about sharing the mapping work over a Bluetooth or WiFi network: <em>\"I'll look up street names, you write down speed limits\"<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there was an archeologist who commented that using more accurate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leica-geosystems.com\/uk\/en\/lgs_4231.htm\">surveying GPSs<\/a>, the same surveying application with a different set of pre-set tags could be very useful in mapping dig sites. The OSM format would even make it very easy to share and visualize maps of various sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm looking forward to getting hold of a copy of Glade to play with the ideas.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Completely unrelated,<\/strong> I learned that reversing the colors on MacBook screen with the <em>Ctrl-Alt-Command-8<\/em> key combination can make the battery last a lot longer.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated 2007-07-16:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/ajturner\/geoclue-state-of-the-map-2007\/\">Slides from our GeoClue talk<\/a> are now available:<\/p>\n\n<p><object type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com:443\/slideshare\/ssplayer.swf?id=78294&amp;doc=geoclue-state-of-the-map-20071559\" width=\"425\" height=\"348\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com:443\/slideshare\/ssplayer.swf?id=78294&amp;doc=geoclue-state-of-the-map-20071559\" \/><\/object><\/p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http:\/\/brainoff.com\/weblog\/2007\/07\/16\/1258\">Mikel Maron's<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/highearthorbit.com\/state-of-the-map-2007\/\">Andrew Turner's<\/a> conference notes and the <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/chrisfleming\/823168744\/in\/photostream\">conference group shot<\/a>.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/maps_in_midgard-abstracted\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Maps in Midgard, abstracted","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2007-07-16 11:06:20","atom:content":"<p>We had some discussion about what features make CMS a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geospatial_Content_Management_System\">GeoCMS<\/a> with <a href=\"http:\/\/georss.org\/geopress\">GeoPress<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/Modules\/category\/65\">Drupal geo<\/a> developers in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stateofthemap.org\/\">State of the Map<\/a>, and a list should be published soon.

(Of course, the RFID chips embedded in everything help the manufacturer get it out the door, but I programmed my own tags so I can't lose anything.) Roomware \u2014 that's houseware to you troglodytes who still live in houses \u2014 is the stuff that runs a hotel room. You know, the remotes that control temperature and unlock the liquor cabinet, plus the window overlay that displays the weather forecast and traffic conditions. Streetware is my mobile's navigator, plus social tags, ad filters, and all those black-and-white barcode blotches painted on walls like graffiti. Cityware is the next scale up. That's how the local government monitors traffic, chases down leaky water mains, and keeps tourists on the straight and narrow.

The reasons are quite clear: simplicity and speed.<\/p>\n\n<p>The whole <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/#2007-07-13-1\">PHP4 end of life<\/a> business has caused quite a bit of discussion in the PHP community. Especially Matt Mullenweg from <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> has <a href=\"http:\/\/photomatt.net\/2007\/07\/13\/on-php\/\">raised vocal opposition<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/photomatt.net\/2007\/07\/13\/on-php\/#comment-422733\">Commenter Johan Delinger said well<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The problem of PHP 4 is its own success. Its so big of a success that it is hard to get people to the (sometimes incompatible) next generation versions. It is definitely the apps working with PHP 4 that drive people to use PHP 4, not PHP 4 itself. If crucial apps, like phpMyAdmin were developed for some other technology at their time, then that would become the de-facto everywhere installed programming environment to work with.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h2>Why Midgard can choose<\/h2>\n\n<p>Midgard's situation differs quite a lot from most other PHP applications. Since much of Midgard works on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation-source-midgard-apache\/\">Apache module<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation-source-midgard-php\/\">PHP extension<\/a> space the users of the framework are not usually relying on hosting providers and their versions but instead run their own servers.<\/p>\n\n<p>This makes us free to focus on the PHP version (and other dependencies) that work best with our framework. Midgard core developer Piotras has estimated that some Midgard functionalities like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgardquerybuilder\/\">Query Builder<\/a> will be substantially faster on PHP5.<\/p>\n\n<p>An important point also is that the PHP part of Midgard is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\">MidCOM<\/a>, a quite large object-oriented component framework. While MidCOM has been possible to develop on PHP4, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.php\">new OOP features in PHP5<\/a> will make the code much easier to develop and understand.<\/p>\n\n<h2>March to Midgard 2<\/h2>\n\n<p>Another reason for making the PHP5 switch now is that Midgard 2 is coming soon. I wanted to have a Midgard 1 series release requiring PHP5 before that just to play safe. Otherwise many users would find themselves trying to upgrade to PHP5 and Midgard2 at the same time, never knowing which one was causing a problem with their code.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_motorcycling\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"On motorcycling","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2007-08-10 12:31:10","atom:content":"<p>My <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/tags\/skoll\">good friend Skoll<\/a> recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.routamc.org\/europe2007\/view\/riding-horses-made-of-steel.html\">wrote of the motorcycling life<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>One of me favourite bands Manowar one sang \"Riding horses made of steel\".

This means your content can also be secure in a server you control.\n<\/p><p>\nYou can connect the data from different services together and enrich it with data produced with Midgard's own components.

In addition to metadata, there is also a GUID field and a sitegroup field. Sitegroups are used for controlling access to content in different \"virtual databases\" in same Midgard instance.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Accessing storage in PHP<\/h2>\n\n<p>When Apache is started Midgard generates PHP classes for all installed MgdSchema types. The class provides the needed I\/O functionality.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is some example code using the Article object that ships with Midgard. It is hopefully understandable by itself:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\/\/ Get empty article instance\n$article = new midgard_article();\n\n\/\/ Set some data into it\n$article-&gt;title = 'Headline';\n$article-&gt;content = '&lt;p&gt;This is my interesting article&lt;\/p&gt;';\n\n\/\/ Store it in database\nif (!$article-&gt;create())\n{\n    echo \"Failed storing the article \\\"{$article-&gt;title}\\\", reason \" . mgd_errstr();\n    \/\/ Note: Midgard 2 raises exceptions in these situations\n}\n\n\/\/ Extend the object. This will be stored in the record_extension table\n$article-&gt;set_parameter('domain', 'name', 'value');\n\n\/\/ Switch language context, IDs point to midgard_language records\nmgd_set_lang(58);\n\n\/\/ Set translated data\n$article-&gt;title = 'Otsikko';\n$article-&gt;content = '&lt;p&gt;T\u00e4m\u00e4 on mielenkiintoinen artikkelini&lt;\/p&gt;';\n\n\/\/ Store it in database\nif (!$article-&gt;update())\n{\n    echo \"Failed updating the article \\\"{$article-&gt;title}\\\" in language {$_MIDGARD['lang']}, reason \" . mgd_errstr();\n    \/\/ Note: Midgard 2 raises exceptions in these situations\n}\n\n\/\/ Then get rid of the article translation of language 58 that we just made\n$article-&gt;delete();\n\n\/\/ Switch back to default language context\nmgd_set_lang(0);\n\n\/\/ Delete also the default article translation, therefore deleting the whole article\n$article-&gt;delete();\n?&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h2>Making queries<\/h2>\n\n<p>Midgard provides two classes for making queries in the database: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgardquerybuilder\/\">Query Builder<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php-midgard_collector\/\">Collector<\/a>. Both classes have same query features, but differ in that <code>midgard_query_builder<\/code> returns full MgdSchema objects and <code>midgard_collector<\/code> returns array of values requested by the user.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple example:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\/\/ Query for full midgard_article objects\n$qb = new midgard_query_builder('midgard_article');\n\n\/\/ WHERE title LIKE 'Midgard sucks%'\n$qb-&gt;add_constraint('title', 'LIKE', 'Midgard sucks%');\n\n\/\/ ORDER BY metadata_published\n$qb-&gt;set_order('metadata.published');\n\n\/\/ Run the query, return matching articles\n$articles = $qb-&gt;execute();\n\n\/\/ Iterate through the article objects\nforeach ($articles as $article)\n{\n    \/\/ These are full MgdSchema objects so we can do things with them\n    $article-&gt;delete();\n}\n?&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>More complex things like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgardquerybuilder-complex-constraints\/\">querying by linked information<\/a> is also possible.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What about MidCOM DBA?<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\/\">MidCOM<\/a> adds <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-dba-object-api\/\">an abstraction layer<\/a> on top of the regular MgdSchema and query classes by extending them on PHP level. This is where lots of additional functionality happens:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nathan-syntronics.de\/midgard\/midcom\/midcom-2_6\/introduction-into-acl.html\">ACL checks<\/a> are done on every I\/O step<\/li>\n<li>Metadata datetime properties are translated to timestamps (in future <a href=\"http:\/\/maetl.coretxt.net.nz\/datetime-in-php\">DateTimes<\/a>) for easier PHP usage<\/li>\n<li>Content changes are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-services-rcs\/\">versioned in RCS<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>To make MidCOM DBA aware of new MgdSchema types, a component has to define a <code>midcom_dba_classes<\/code> configuration file, and refer to it in the manifest:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>array(\n    'table' =&gt; 'org_routamc_statusmessage_message',\n    'old_class_name' =&gt; null,\n    'new_class_name' =&gt; 'org_routamc_statusmessage_message',\n    'midcom_class_name' =&gt; 'org_routamc_statusmessage_message_dba'\n),\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>When MidCOM refreshes its cache, it will create a new MidCOM DBA class <code>__org_routamc_statusmessage_message_dba<\/code> that will extend the <code>org_routamc_statusmessage_message<\/code> MgdSchema class.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a component developer wants to add additional business logic to the object, he can then define his own <code>org_routamc_statusmessage_message_dba<\/code> class in the component that will extend the <code>__org_routamc_statusmessage_message_dba<\/code> class.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_supports_openid\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Midgard supports OpenID","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2007-08-28 12:44:43","atom:content":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-72b3c356556411dc83ae09e611214ef44ef4\/OpenID.jpg\" height=\"60\" width=\"160\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"OpenID\" title=\"OpenID\" style=\"float: right;\" \/>\nInspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/froscon.phpugdo.de\/\">a talk in FrOSCon<\/a> on Sunday, I went and implemented <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenID\">OpenID<\/a> support into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> on the flight back.

The way this works is the following:<\/p>\n\n<p>I go to a page that requires authentication, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/logging-into-midcom\/\">to MidCOM's login URL<\/a> and I get a login form allowing me to either input a local username\/password combination or my OpenID:<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-6ad558c0556411dcb55867679701f379f379\/midgard-openid-login-initial-1.jpg\" height=\"193\" width=\"300\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Midgard-Openid-Login-Initial-1\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">(yes, I know this screen still needs some CSS love)<\/p>\n\n<p>If this is the first time I'm using OpenID for this particular site, or I haven't yet logged in to <a href=\"http:\/\/signup.mylid.net\/signup\/\">my OpenID provider<\/a>, it will next ask me for confirmation:<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-72222ea0556411dcb6d2b5bcebe6ad56ad56\/mylid-login.jpg\" height=\"142\" width=\"397\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Mylid-Login\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">(this step is skipped if I already have authorized login for the site and am logged in)<\/p>\n\n<p>After this a MidCOM login session is generated for the OpenID identity and I'm logged in to the Midgard site. I even get a nice notice about this:<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-7329bc00556411dc8c7f8f6c00a0b384b384\/midgard-openid-success-1.jpg\" height=\"110\" width=\"298\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Midgard-Openid-Success-1\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The OpenID implementation is <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/browser\/trunk\/midcom\/net.nemein.openid\">now available in MidCOM SVN<\/a>. It should be reasonably useful already now, but I will still make some improvements to it, including:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Adding the OpenID user to a group specified in component configuration<\/li><li>Using <a href=\"http:\/\/openid.net\/specs\/openid-simple-registration-extension-1_1-01.html\">Simple Registration Extension<\/a> together with Midgard's account registration schema to pull in more information about the OpenID user if available<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>It would also be nice to enable using Midgard as an <a href=\"http:\/\/openid.net\/wiki\/index.php\/Run_your_own_identity_server\">OpenID provider<\/a>, but for now <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openidenabled.com\/openid\/use-your-own-url-as-an-openid\">URL delegation<\/a> is needed.<\/p>\n\n<!-- technorati tags start -->\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10px;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/authentication\" rel=\"tag\">authentication<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/midcom\" rel=\"tag\">midcom<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/midgard\" rel=\"tag\">midgard<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/openid\" rel=\"tag\">openid<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/sso\" rel=\"tag\">sso<\/a><\/p>\n\n<!-- technorati tags end -->\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/greg_stein_got_mugged\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Greg Stein got mugged :-(","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2007-08-28 14:05:59","atom:content":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-cd1ccf30556f11dcb04465aacc3e95e395e3\/michael_wechner_and_greg_stein.jpg\" height=\"311\" width=\"300\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Michael Wechner and Greg Stein\" title=\"Michael Wechner and Greg Stein\" style=\"float: right;\" \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lyra.org\/greg\/\">Greg Stein<\/a>, of WebDAV, SVN and ASF fame, <a href=\"http:\/\/feedblog.org\/2007\/08\/27\/greg-stein-director-of-the-apache-software-foundation-was-mugged-accepting-donations\/\">got violently mugged last Friday<\/a> in Mountain View:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote><p>They gave Greg a black eye and a serious laceration to the head which required numerous stiches.

OpenID is a lightweight single sign-on and auto-registration system for web applications. In concept it is quite similar to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shibboleth_(Internet2)\">Shibboleth<\/a> but easier to deploy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since <a href=\"http:\/\/openid.net\/what\/\">OpenID can solve a lot of issues<\/a> with registration to social web services, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> has been <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_supports_openid.html\">supporting it since last August<\/a>. However, OpenID has one major security problem: as the cross-site redirections are controlled by the site user is visiting, OpenID has quite a <a href=\"http:\/\/simonwillison.net\/2007\/Jan\/19\/phishing\/\">high potential for phishing attacks<\/a>. One way to reduce that risk is to use <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/One-time_password\">one-time password<\/a>s with OpenID instead of the usual username\/passphrase combination.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Enter Yubikey<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>The problem with OTP is that disposable password lists are a lot of hassle. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SecurID\">RSA's SecurID<\/a> device has been one approach to solve that by having a simple device to generate the one-time passwords that user can then enter on their computer. But SecurIDs are expensive and manually typing the number sets is tedious.<\/p>\n\n<p>Simon's company <a href=\"http:\/\/yubico.com\/\">Yubico<\/a> has approached the problem from a bit different direction: their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yubico.com\/products\/index\">Yubikey<\/a> is a small, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yubico.com\/products\/order\">cheap<\/a> USB dongle that the computer sees as a \"keyboard\". Insert the key, press the button, and the one-time password will be entered.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was given a key and have been <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.yubico.com\/start-here\">testing it a bit<\/a> today to authenticate via <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/\">my OpenID identity<\/a> to various websites, and it really was <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.yubico.com\/start\/openid\">as easy as advertised<\/a>. Now my OpenID <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.yubico.com\/technology\/review\">is secure<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-2293353ca59111dca3ce8b5c2d26615e615e\/_press_yubikey_hand_comp.jpg\" height=\"174\" width=\"240\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Yubikey usage\" title=\"Yubikey usage\" \/>\nIn addition to OpenID, Yubikey authentication is supported via RADIUS and PAM, and <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.yubico.com\/apis\/start\">libraries are available<\/a> for integrating it with other authentication systems.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Yubikey is not without problems<\/strong>, unfortunately. While authentication client libraries are open source, the actual authentication server is proprietary and operated by Yubico, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yubico.com\/about\/people\">a small start-up<\/a>. If Yubico's network goes down, the whole authentication system becomes unusable.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd love to use Yubikeys for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/en\/\">my company<\/a> and several of my customers. Therefore, I really hope Yubico will be able to either release the server sources directly, or at least make a pledge to release them in case of going out of business.

It wakes us up in the morning, and tells news in the evening. It is small and stylish, and it mixes well with the environment.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIts utilities include e.g. a browser for surfing the net, Skype for phone calls, and several radios. Its smallness allows it to be enjoyed together, not separately as often happens with our personal computers. Several times a day we look at weather information, and TV programme guides. Also we use it in looking for dogs in need of home, this being the most important project at the moment.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThough its screen is small, the tablet can be used professionally e.g. to monitor large systems with nagios, as the problem components are discernible due to alert colors. This can be handy for remote control.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSkype phone is very easy to use, and we can use it as a speakerphone or with Bluetooth headset. Speakerphone is quite pleasant, as there is no audio feedback from speakers to microphone. Screen quality is good, which enables showing photos as slideshow.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe tablet is easy to use, though there are some difficulties that might be improved in its successor, N810. Screen lock is not very intuitive, the procedure is implemented like in cellphones. In using the screen keyboard it is extremely easy to press &lt;ENTER&gt; and so it is easy to write e.g. an erroneous URL.\n<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">\n<span style=\"font-size:10pt;\">\n<br \/>Technorati Tags: <\/span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/maemo\">maemo<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;\">, <\/span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/n800\">n800<\/a><\/span>\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/open_source_companies_of_europe-unite\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Open Source companies of Europe, unite!","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-01-22 15:42:20","atom:content":"<p><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-ed2def354d999300645be7fc5198c225\/EU_flag.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin-left:8px;\" alt=\"EU_flag.jpg\" \/>\nA week ago I spent some time in Berlin <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/in_coss_steering_group.html\">representing the Finnish Centre for Open Source Solutions<\/a> (COSS).

In there we started formulating our ideas of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coverfire.com\/archives\/2006\/04\/25\/jabberxmpp-pubsub\/\">XMPP publish\/subscribe<\/a> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.xmpp.org\/extensions\/xep-0060.html\">XEP-0060<\/a>) based replication for both <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajatus.info\/\">Ajatus<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This post contains very early ideas, but we would be happy to get some feedback on them.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Basic idea<\/h2>\n\n<p>Each Midgard or Ajatus server runs a &quot;synchronization daemon&quot; which is connected to a XMPP server using some JID identity.<\/p>\n\n<p>The sync daemon registers a set of pub\/sub nodes corresponding to the content structure on the Midgard or Ajatus instance:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>in Midgard: Sitegroups, MgdSchema types, paths (possibly a regexp), approval state\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>\/midgard_article\/all<\/code>, <code>\/midgard_article\/approved<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>in Ajatus: tags<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The pub\/sub nodes can be set up with some access control rules. For example, Ajatus tags would by default require &quot;whitelist&quot; authorization to subscribe.<\/p>\n\n<p>When content is changed, the sync daemon gets notified about it (via D-Bus signals in Midgard, and via CouchDb external indexer API in Ajatus).\nThe content object (and immediate children like parameters and file attachments) is serialized into the syndication format and sent onward as a XMPP &quot;pub&quot; leaf. If the object appears on multiple nodes (multiple Ajatus tags for instance), the &quot;pub&quot; leaf is sent to all of them.<\/p>\n\n<p>XMPP server and the federated network will then handle notifying the subscribers of the nodes about the new leaf.<\/p>\n\n<p>The subscribers will receive the leaf, and unserialize it to the Ajatus or Midgard database.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Communication between sync daemon and application<\/h2>\n\n<p>The sync daemon should exist as an entity separate from the actual user application. Communication between the sync daemon and Midgard or Ajatus should happen via the application database.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that XMPP pub\/sub whitelists for Ajatus tags would be maintained in the ajatus_db (non-replicated) database, and the sync daemon would read them from there. The Jabber server credentials would also be stored in the same database.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Information about resources from jabber buddies<\/h3>\n\n<p>User's replication partners are stored as local contacts in the application database. In Ajatus this means &quot;Contacts&quot; and in Midgard &quot;midgard_person&quot; objects. Both storage models have optional JID field.<\/p>\n\n<p>If JID is marked for a contact, the sync daemon should at startup (or at an interval) try to discover if the contact has pub\/sub resources available.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Content transformation in replication stage<\/h2>\n\n<p>While mainly intended for Midgard-to-Midgard and Ajatus-to-Ajatus replication, the same mechanisms could work across different systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>For this, the sync daemon on the subscribing end should support XSLT transformations before content is unserialized into the system. The XSLT transformation templates should be configurable per subscription.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Hermod \/ Herm\u00f3\u00f0r (Midgard replication)<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;in Norse mythology, messenger of the gods.

MidCOM 2.8 is a very capable (if heavy) platform that we will be able to support for a long time. It is also important, as...\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Next step:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/1.9\">Midgard 1.9<\/a>, MidCOM 2.9 and PHP 5.2\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nHaving consolidated sites to MidCOM 2.8 and PHP 5.2, it will be very easy to migrate to Midgard 1.9 (PHP4 not supported). While Midgard API changes somewhat (Exceptions, Midgard_Connection) between 1.8 and 1.9, MidCOM 2.9 (currently called &quot;trunk&quot;) is able to hide that from site builders.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Mid-term:<\/strong> Midgard 1.9, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.l.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbergie.iki.fi%2Fblog%2Fsome_plans_for_midcom_3.html&amp;ei=UDHZR5aBEIv2wwGA6KGsCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQ3rNK3au_rKV9pFWGCdlDhlJodw&amp;sig2=pmP2wAex6bqrh1IJKbfCZA\">MidCOM 3.0<\/a> and PHP 5.2\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe main reasons to switch from Midgard 1.8 to Midgard 1.9 are performance, new installer and the ability to run MidCOM 3 alongside MidCOM 2.8. While MidCOM 3 requires complete site rewrite from 2.8\/2.9, this phase makes migrations and running sites with both versions on same server possible.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Long-term:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/milestone\/Midgard%202.0\">Midgard 2.0<\/a>, MidCOM 3.0 and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dotvoid.com\/view.php?id=57\">PHP 6<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nOnce a server has completely migrated from MidCOM 2.x sites onwards, it will be possible to make the final jump to the full new generation Midgard platform.\n<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10px;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/midcom\">midcom<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/midgard\">midgard<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/php\">php<\/a><\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/semantic_web_is_here-yahoo-and_microformats\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Semantic web is here: Yahoo! and microformats","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-03-14 08:57:34","atom:content":"<p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-a51ba4d0f1a411dc92b09fd790a2ceeeceee\/microformats.png\" height=\"127\" width=\"120\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Microformats\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Semantic_Web\">Semantic web<\/a>, the platform that could enable <a href=\"http:\/\/technology.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/tech_and_web\/article3532832.ece\">new businesses to rival the likes of Google<\/a> has for a long time been a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/xml\/blog\/2006\/06\/the_7_flaws_of_the_semantic_we.html\">distant promise<\/a>. Much of this has been because the standardization bodies have focused on too difficult and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Resource_Description_Framework\">impractical technologies<\/a> instead of building it on top of existing web implementations.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/about\/\">Microformats<\/a> are a more pragmatic approach: by using <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/wiki\/Main_Page#Specifications\">simple naming and mark-up convention<\/a>s the semantic information can easily be <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/wiki\/posh\">added into web pages<\/a> that will then suddenly become readable by both humans and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/contact-management-in-semantic-web.html\">computers<\/a>. Microformats have been around for a while now, but have so far remained quite exclusive to a small group of web geeks.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis is about to change, though: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ysearchblog.com\/archives\/000527.html\">Yahoo! has announced<\/a> that its search service will <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nickhalstead.com\/2008\/03\/13\/yahoo-tackles-semantic-web\/\">utilize Microformats<\/a> to present much <a href=\"http:\/\/tools.search.yahoo.com\/newsearch\/open.html\">more useful results<\/a> to end-users. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwriteweb.com\/archives\/yahoo_supports_semantic_web.php\">Google will likely follow<\/a>. This means that suddenly search engines will understand about <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/wiki\/hcard\">addresses of companies<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/wiki\/hreview\">product reviews<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/wiki\/hcalendar\">event scheduling<\/a> and many other things, and will make these easily accessible to consumers.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAt the same time, <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/devnews\/index.php\/2008\/03\/10\/firefox-3-beta-4-now-available-for-download\/\">Firefox 3 is nearing release<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwriteweb.com\/archives\/mozilla_does_microformats_firefox3.php\">will support Microformats<\/a> directly, so <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/firefox-extension-for-microformat-utilization.html\">extensions for doing it<\/a> may not be necessary. With both browsers and search engines covered, Microformats should quickly become very easy to find and utilize.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSo now our users and customers will start to reap benefits from the fact that we've been seeding <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/microformat-usage-in-midcom\/\">Midgard CMS default templates<\/a> and customer implementations with Microformats <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/openpsa-calendar-goes-horizontal.html\">since summer 2005<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10px;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/microformats\">microformats<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/search\">search<\/a><\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midcom_3_at_a_glance\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"MidCOM 3 at a glance","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-03-18 12:21:18","atom:content":"<p>This document has been written as a quick <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgardized<\/a> version of the nice \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/documentation\/overview\/\">Django at a glance<\/a>\" tutorial, in order to explain how the new and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/some_plans_for_midcom_3.html\">upcoming MidCOM 3 framework<\/a> works.

It provides several basic building blocks like toolbars, access controls and management of static content pages out-of-the-box.<\/p>\n\n<p>MidCOM applications are built as \"components\" with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-midcom-specs-architecture-namespacing\/\">Java-like namespacing<\/a>. This means that a \"news\" component designed by company named Nemein could be called <code>net_nemein_news<\/code>. Components are run on a Midgard site by setting a folder of the site to use that component.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Design your model<\/h2>\n\n<p>MidCOM uses Midgard's MgdSchema object-relational mapping system for providing easy object-oriented API for database storage. Models are described using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema-file\/\">XML syntax<\/a>, and Midgard then provides OOP APIs to them for C, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema-in-php\/\">PHP<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.nemein.com\/people\/piotras\/view\/1178275038.html\">Python<\/a> languages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple example MdgSchema:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;Schema xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/repligard\/1.4\"&gt;\n  &lt;type name=\"net_nemein_news_article\" table=\"net_nemein_news_article\"&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"id\" type=\"integer\" primaryfield=\"id\" \/&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"name\" type=\"string\"\/&gt; \n    &lt;property name=\"title\" type=\"string\" multilang=\"yes\" table=\"net_nemein_news_article_i\" \/&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"content\" type=\"longtext\" multilang=\"yes\" table=\"net_nemein_news_article_i\" \/&gt;\n  &lt;\/type&gt;    \n&lt;\/Schema&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Other fields like <em>author<\/em> or <em>publication date<\/em> do not need to be defined in the MgdSchema as Midgard automatically extends all records with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema-metadata-object\/\">a set of metadata properties<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Install it<\/h2>\n\n<p>Place the MgdSchema XML file to <code>\/usr\/share\/midgard\/schema<\/code>, and then create the database tables based on it by running:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ midgard-schema midgard\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>midgard<\/code> is the name of your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/unified-configuration\/\">Midgard conf.d file<\/a> that defines the database access parameters like database type and password.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Enjoy the free API<\/h2>\n\n<p>These steps are all you need to do to have new Midgard objects at your disposal. Now you can access and manipulate them using for example Python or PHP. With PHP, the API looks like this:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\/\/ Create a new person\n$reporter = new midgard_person();\n$reporter-&gt;firstname = 'John';\n$reporter-&gt;lastname = 'Smith';\n\n\/\/ Save it to the database\n$reporter-&gt;create();\n\n\/\/ Now it has an UUID\necho\u00a0$reporter-&gt;guid;\n\n\/\/ And it can be fetched from the database\n$qb = midgard_person::new_query_builder();\nprint_r($qb-&gt;execute());\n\/\/ This would print an array of midgard_person objects containing \"John Smith\"\n\n\/\/ We have multiple ways to query objects\n$qb-&gt;add_constraint('lastname', 'LIKE', 'Smi%');\nprint_r($qb-&gt;execute());\n\n\/\/ Create a new article\n$article = new net_nemein_news_article();\n$article-&gt;title = 'MidCOM is cool';\n$article-&gt;metadata-&gt;authors = $reporter-&gt;guid;\n$article-&gt;create();\n\n\/\/ Extend the article with new properties\n$article-&gt;parameter('namespace', 'key', 'value');\n\n\/\/ Localize the article to Finnish\nmgd_set_lang('fi');\n$article-&gt;title = 'MidCOM on \u00e4ltsin magee';\n$article-&gt;update();\n\n\/\/ Delete the Finnish translation\n$article-&gt;delete();\n\n\/\/\/ etc\n?&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h2>A dynamic admin interface<\/h2>\n\n<p>Midgard comes with <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/building_a_new_admin_interface_for_midgard.html\">Asgard<\/a>, an automated administrative interface which provides a full editing tool to all our installed MgdSchemas. If your define a tree model for your storage, it will even provide a nice navigation tree for them. For example:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;Schema xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/repligard\/1.4\"&gt;\n  &lt;type name=\"net_nemein_news_article\" table=\"net_nemein_news_article\" parent=\"midgard_topic\"&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"id\" type=\"integer\" primaryfield=\"id\" \/&gt;    \n    &lt;property name=\"name\" type=\"string\"\/&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"title\" type=\"string\" multilang=\"yes\" table=\"net_nemein_news_article_i\" \/&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"content\" type=\"longtext\" multilang=\"yes\" table=\"net_nemein_news_article_i\" \/&gt;\n    &lt;property name=\"topic\" type=\"integer\" link=\"midgard_topic:id\" parentfield=\"topic\"\/&gt;\n  &lt;\/type&gt;    \n&lt;\/Schema&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>After this the <code>net_nemein_news_article<\/code> objects would be stored under topics, and could be browsed in the topic tree hierarchy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Asgard understands linked properties, datetime fields, and other MgdSchema field types and provides appropriate editing tools for them. For example, linked fields automatically become search-based choosers.<\/p>\n\n<p>At this point you can already start entering content to your new application using the Asgard tool.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Design your URLs<\/h2>\n\n<p>A clean URL space is important in a modern web framework, and with Midgard clean URLs have been the norm even since the 90s.<\/p>\n\n<p>In MidCOM your application URL space is set up as something called \"routes\". They are entered in YAML format to the component's configuration file, in this case <code>net_nemein_news\/configuration\/defaults.yml<\/code>. The routes follow the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/internet-drafts\/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-02.txt\">IETF URI template draft<\/a> format.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, a route for displaying a particular article could be defined as:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>show:\n    controller: net_nemein_news_controllers_article\n    action: show\n    route: \/{$name}\/\n    content_entry_point: nnn-show-article\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>In this case, the URL to a news article would be <code>\/foldername\/articlename<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The routes define many things about what MidCOM should do with the request. First of all, they define which controller PHP class, and which action method in it will deal with the request. Additionally the route can define a <code>template_entry_point<\/code> or <code>content_entry_point<\/code> to choose which template files will be used for displaying the page. Other things like templating language and MIME type can also be defined in the configuration file.<\/p>\n\n<p>Routes are stored in configuration file so that they can be easily overridden on per-site, or even per-folder basis. This means that migration from some other CMS system is quite easy as the site can be configured to retain the old URL formats.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Write your controllers<\/h2>\n\n<p>Each controller is responsible for doing one of two things: Populating a <code>data<\/code> array with content of the requested page, or raising an exception like <code>midcom_exception_notfound<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The controller class in this case would be stored to <code>net_nemein_news\/controllers\/article.php<\/code> and could look like the following:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>public function action_show($route_id, &amp;$data, $args)\n{\n    $qb = net_nemein_news_article::new_query_builder();\n    $qb-&gt;add_constraint('name', '=', $args['name']);        \n    $articles = $qb-&gt;execute();        \n    if (count($articles) == 0)\n    {\n        throw new midcom_exception_notfound(\"Article {$args['name']} not found.\");\n    }\n    $data['article'] = $articles[0];\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>After the controller has produced the data it will then be passed to the MidCOM templating system according to the entry points defined for the route.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Design your templates<\/h2>\n\n<p>MidCOM uses the <a href=\"http:\/\/phptal.motion-twin.com\/manual\/en\/\">Template Abstraction Language<\/a> (TAL) for its templating purposes. TAL is a very powerful templating system in the sense that it allows designers to build the site XML or XHTML templates and fill them with example data that will then be replaced with the real data when TAL is run.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this case our template would be placed in <code>net_nemein_news\/templates\/nnn-show-article.php<\/code>. It could contain something like:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"hentry\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1 tal:content=\"net_nemein_news\/article\/title\" class=\"entry-title\"&gt;Headline&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n    &lt;div tal:content=\"net_nemein_news\/article\/metadata\/published\" class=\"published\"&gt;2007-08-01&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div tal:content=\"structure net_nemein_news\/article\/content\" class=\"entry-content\"&gt;\n        Content\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The XHTML attributes in the <code>tal<\/code> namespace <a href=\"http:\/\/phptal.motion-twin.com\/manual\/en\/#tal-namespace\">contain the rules<\/a> used by TAL for replacing the example data with the real data from the controller. The data array of the controller is exposed to tal using the component name, in this case <code>net_nemein_news<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The default template supplied by the component <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-page_and_style\/\">can be overridden<\/a> by placing an element named <code>nnn-show-article<\/code> to either the site main style, or as an element of the current folder.<\/p>\n\n<h2>This is just the surface<\/h2>\n\n<p>This has been a very quick overview of the MidCOM framework.

To those unfamiliar with GeoClue, here is a quick intro:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nGeoClue is a modular geoinformation service built on top of the D-Bus messaging system. The goal of the GeoClue project is to make creating location-aware applications for mobile Linux devices as simple as possible.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nLast summer with the Summer of Code we were able to make a <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/geoclue_is_appearing.html\">first full implementation of GeoClue<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/vilunki.wordpress.com\/2007\/08\/22\/geoclue-08-soc-released\/\">release it<\/a> for the <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/\">maemo<\/a> platform. There were also GeoClue sessions held in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/ajturner\/geoclue-state-of-the-map-2007\">State of the Map<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.guadec.org\/node\/581\">GUADEC<\/a> conferences.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, as that implementation did not provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Software\/GeoClue#head-15bcdec2110a8515956187b4137ad8702f540762\">a master provider<\/a> to abstract away the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Software\/GeoClue#head-e73ac91b0697338613054a80e3a0f496e4f0714f\">different position sources<\/a>, it was still a bit cumbersome to develop GeoClue-powered applications. So when Jussi got hired by <a href=\"http:\/\/o-hand.com\/\">OpenedHand<\/a>, a decision was made to <a href=\"http:\/\/vilunki.wordpress.com\/2007\/11\/10\/api-stability-whazzat\/\">change the API<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nNow finally the API change work starts to be complete, and a new release of GeoClue should appear pretty soon.

I've been a fan of the project since late 90s, and I'm sad to see the state of things, but... the KDE people seem to be quite determined in their progress, while in GNOME land people seem to be mostly in conservative maintenance mode.

Now with some personnel changes including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.runtoshop.com\/contact.html\">Joe's<\/a> departure it was a good time to change the way we work again.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nI had some goals:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Keeping status of different projects up-to-date with more accuracy<\/li>\n<li>Ensuring our sales and project management knows if some project is being blocked by missing materials<\/li>\n<li>Enabling a more distributed, <a href=\"http:\/\/webworkerdaily.com\/2006\/09\/04\/going-bedouin\/\">web working<\/a> culture<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nWe're a small company of <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/people\/\">less than 10 people<\/a>, and as such most project management methods have not been very successful for us. In general they have been made for situations where same person or team keeps on working on a project for several months, whereas in our situation a person typically works on several projects every day.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nI discussed this over some beers with <a href=\"http:\/\/teroheikkinen.iki.fi\/\">Tero Heikkinen<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/plazes.com\/plazes\/135439_rohea\">Rohea<\/a>, and he told me how they were implementing <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scrum_(development)\">Scrum<\/a> in their small company. While their number of different projects running at the same time is a bit smaller, their situation otherwise is quite similar: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">same technologies<\/a> used, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajatus.info\/\">Ajatus<\/a> for work tracking, etc.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWe had a company <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/2544964382\/\">sauna evening<\/a> and I presented Tero's ideas there: we would partially implement the Scrum model, and keep tuning it to our needs. At the first phase this means:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Every morning we have an all-hands 15-20min meeting (\"the daily Scrum\") where everybody goes over what they have been doing the previous day, and what they were planning to do today. If they are being blocked by something missing: a software bug, missing information or other materials, this is also brought forward<\/li>\n<li>Every project has a file in <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.google.com\/\">Google Docs<\/a> where we keep the project status and task list (Backlog). This task list is updated based on what comes up in the morning meeting<\/li>\n<li>Work hours are reported with Ajatus. Rohea also uses it for project <a href=\"http:\/\/www.controlchaos.com\/about\/burndown.php\">burn-down charts<\/a>, and once their add-on for that is finished we may do the same<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/people\/semi\/\">Emilia<\/a>, the project manager (or Scrum Master) is responsible for resolving possible impediments and maintaining the per-project status files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nThe approach we have taken should be quite pragmatic and low-tech. Instead of fancy project management software we use simple word processing for status data. And thanks to Google Docs the documents produced are accessible and editable from anywhere.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSimilarly the actual meetings are quite easy to manage. The people who are at the office attend there, and others attend either via a Skype or mobile phone conference call, depending on network availability. We decided to have them at 10am so that everybody will be able to participate. Even if there is a Sprint or meeting scheduled for the same time, the short time needed for our all-hands meeting means it can be held over a \"cigarette break\".\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAjatus is the only more experimental piece of software in our puzzle. In our company, we use it for hour reporting, expense tracking and keeping meeting minutes. For these it works quite well, although more reporting tools are definitely needed. The alpha status of <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/couchdb\/\">CouchDb<\/a>, the database software powering Ajatus has bit us a few times by database corruption (caused by OSX-specific erlang bug) or simply difficult installation procedure, but these problems will hopefully improve over time.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWe're now in the second week of this model, and at least the gut feel is that this has improved coordination inside the company. The next challenge then is to let the customer get involved in the process. This can mean just sharing the project status files, or even giving them access to actual meetings or the Ajatus data.\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/nuvi_880-first_device_to_carry_geoclue\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"n\u00fcvi 880: First device to carry GeoClue?","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-06-13 10:17:11","atom:content":"<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-df2525a0393111dd8e19cff0c0a20c890c89\/garmin-nuvi-880.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-e2194a20393111ddaaef9112f3e2841e841e\/garmin-nuvi-880-tm.jpg\" height=\"160\" width=\"160\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"8\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Garmin n\u00fcvi 880\" title=\"Garmin n\u00fcvi 880\" \/><\/a>\n<br \/>GPS manufacturer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.garmin.com\/garmin\/cms\/site\/us\">Garmin<\/a> has recently <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.garmin.com\/linux\/\">released the modified sources<\/a> of their n\u00fcvi 880 and 5000 in-car navigators. <a href=\"http:\/\/butterfeet.org\/?p=57\">Looking at the packages<\/a> reveals that these devices are powered by <a href=\"http:\/\/gnome.org\/mobile\">GNOME Mobile<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/geoclue.freedesktop.org\/\">GeoClue<\/a>, the toolkit for <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/iphone-geoclue_and_making_mobile_devices_location-aware.html\">making mobile Linux applications location-aware<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nOn downloading and Inspecting the large (and nicely organized) 8xx source tarball (list of files here) its very apparent the device built upon a <a href=\"http:\/\/gnome.org\/mobile\">GNOME Mobile<\/a> based stack (with <a href=\"http:\/\/x.org\/\">X<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/matchbox-project.org\/\">Matchbox<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/gtk.org\/\">GTK+<\/a> etc).

This release does not consist of the CMS components, but instead targets at providing the development tools for building a modern web framework. Framework based not only on one tool, but which can connect multiple technologies and languages. \n<br \/><br \/>Changes from alpha1: The Apache module is no longer supported. Support for D-BUS is built in. Many improvements were made in language bindings. The PHP module is now configurable with ini directives. \n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nEspecially the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/python_midgard\/\">Python bindings<\/a> for Midgard 2 are interesting.

Some may suggest we need someone like Steve Jobs, whilst others would like to spend more money on launch events. They are both wrong! Trying to copy Steve Jobs or Microsoft's deep pockets is mission impossible. If Apple or Microsoft notices we are trying to catch up, they will simply improve their key strategic advantages and catching up will become even more challenging for us. What do we have to do then?\n<br \/><br \/>Community is in what we excel; our key strategic advantage. To repeat the marketing success of Apple and Microsoft we need to leverage the community. Massive synchronized releasing is the perfect tool to achieve this leverage. By synchronizing, release related marketing efforts of multiple communities are focused at the same moment and can leverage each other. The rhythm of so much projects doing their marketing efforts at the same moment will shake the Internet.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nSynchronized, or timed and regular software releases are already being utilized for example <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.ubuntu.com\/TimeBasedReleases\">by the Ubuntu distribution<\/a>. This helps companies and individual end users to carefully plan their upgrade strategy. But in addition, it makes it easy for technology writers to <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/news.ars\/post\/20080629-horny-for-ubuntu-8-10-first-look-at-intrepid-ibex.html\">write about the new releases<\/a>. When plans and schedules are clear, articles will more likely appear.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWith <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>, the project is riddled with very varying release cycles. At the moment we're simultaneously <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/big_midgard_release_day.html\">working on major releases<\/a> in <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/some_midgard_roadmapping.html\">two different generations<\/a> of the platform, and on top of that actively maintaining and developing the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/1.8\/\">stable 1.8\/2.8 branch<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis has led to the situation where testing cycles can be excessively long. For example, MidCOM 2.8 was in beta for ten months, and has seen <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.midcom-project.org\/index.php?package=midcom&amp;downloads\">13 minor updates<\/a> since <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/view\/midcom_2-8-0_released.html\">the stable release<\/a>. Similarly, Midgard 1.8 is in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/view\/1212065673.html\">its eight update<\/a>. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/\">documentation<\/a> has a hard time staying up-to-date with all this.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis would already make keeping up with Midgard difficult, but the situation is exacerbated by the fact that Midgard can be so many different things:\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-f7ac2de2475711dda0152917fd6db159b159\/layers-of-midgard.png\" height=\"331\" width=\"336\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Layers of Midgard\" title=\"Layers of Midgard\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>\nFor some developers Midgard means the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgard-core\/\">libmidgard<\/a> object persistence and replication library, and its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php_midgard_core\/\">various<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/python_midgard\/\">language<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_2-more_than_just_php-more_than_just_cms.html\">bindings<\/a>. For some it is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\">MidCOM<\/a>, an <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midcom_3_at_a_glance.html\">MVC framework for PHP<\/a> that can be used to build any kind of web services. For some it is <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.midcom-project.org\/index.php?category=1&amp;page=1\">a component<\/a> specific for a task like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference-components-net.nemein.registrations\/\">event registrations management<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/direct-marketing-component-for-openpsa.html\">direct marketing<\/a>. And finally, for some it is a full end-user application suite like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/1.8\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openpsa.org\/\">OpenPsa<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nMidgard is a good tool. We have lots of great code and functionality, and a <a href=\"http:\/\/boids.name\/empty\/articles\/2007\/08\/02\/midgard-at-protva\">nice<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_developers_in_linkoping.html\">community<\/a> to top that off. But for a regular end user of free software it is very difficult to understand the whole Midgard ecosystem, and where is sits with competition on the various layers. On CMS (or applications) layer we're competing with the likes of <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/\">Drupal<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/plone.org\/\">Plone<\/a>, on MVC framework layer with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rubyonrails.org\/\">Ruby on Rails<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/\">Django<\/a>, and so on.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSo, how to move forward? Here are some ideas:\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Differentiate the various layers<\/strong>, and their individual components more clearly marketing-wise. Instead of calling all of this Midgard we should introduce names for different collections. This is what we used to do with <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/news\/8038db7b7ad7882ef4bb66acb7707ebb.html\">Aegir CMS<\/a> in early 2000s with great results, and what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/firefox\">has worked very well<\/a> for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/about\/whatismozilla.html\">Mozilla<\/a> project.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIn this scenario Midgard would be the central community name, and probably the name of the persistence layer. The other tools would use their own marketing names. Also components would get rid of their too techy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-midcom-specs-architecture-namespacing\/\">namespace-based names<\/a> and use something more human readable in their marketing.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis also means redesigning the Midgard site to provide more visibility to the different parts. Something closer to the <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/downloads\/OS2008\/\">maemo application catalogue<\/a> would be far better than our <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.midcom-project.org\/index.php?category=1&amp;amp;page=1\">current component list<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Synchronize releases<\/strong>. This could mean digging up the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/development\/mrfc\/view\/0008.html\">time-based Midgard release process<\/a> proposal from mothballs, or just ensuring that libmidgard, MidCOM, documentation and the important components all are developed <a href=\"http:\/\/useopensource.blogspot.com\/2008\/04\/synching-open-source-release-schedule.html\">in sync<\/a> with each other. On wider scale this could also mean trying to keep the pace with releases of dependencies like <a href=\"http:\/\/snaps.php.net\/\">PHP<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome-db.org\/\">libgda<\/a>, or with important platforms like <a href=\"http:\/\/release.debian.org\/\">debian<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/action\/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9000903&amp;source=rss_topic122\">RHEL<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis probably requires finding new resources and tools for <strong>testing and documentation<\/strong>. For example the <a href=\"http:\/\/midgardwiki.contentcontrol-berlin.de\/index.php\/Main_Page\">unofficial Midgard wiki<\/a> is often in better state than the official one, so why not merge them? Similarly, keeping <a href=\"http:\/\/teroheikkinen.iki.fi\/blog\/view\/midcom_3_virtual_machine.html\">downloadable virtual machine images<\/a> available should make testing new Midgard releases a lot easier.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThese of course are just ideas. In any case the transition to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_2-finally_legacy-free.html\">Midgard2<\/a> makes it possible for us to rethink a lot of these things.\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/professional_versus_personal_blogging\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Professional versus personal blogging","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-07-03 15:08:53","atom:content":"<p>\nMy blog is where I post mostly about things related to technology, while personal happenings are noted in my Jaiku lifestream.

This could be done by setting up an easy Midgard <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/browse.html?node=201590011\">EC2 image<\/a> for instance<\/li>\n<li>The processing clouds could act as front-ends by themselves via <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Round_robin_DNS\">round-robin DNS<\/a>, or there could be front-end MidCOM servers that would call the processing nodes via <em>MidCOM3 remote routing<\/em> (feature that we've discussed but not implemented yet)<\/li>\n<li>Each processing node would be completely independent and contain its own database<\/li>\n<li>There would be a replication queue stored on permanent storage service like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/browse.html?node=16427261\">S3<\/a> that each processing node would replicate to and from<\/li>\n<li>When a processing node would boot up, it would connect to the appropriate S3 bucket and populate itself with data<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nImplemented this way it would be easy to add or subtract Midgard servers as needed. Each of them would be autonomous from application developer's perspective, but data replication would ensure each node would stay in sync with others.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis would certainly be worth experimenting with.

It is a modern system compiled from the ancient traditional sword techniques of Korea.\n<br \/><br \/>The movements are primarily circular and derive their power from centrifugal force of the body. Training develops strength, coordination, balance, focus, stamina, speed and flexibility.\n<br \/><br \/>Haedong in old Chinese language means Korea (Hae - sea or sun, Dong - east). Kumdo translates to way of life through the art of sword (kum - sword, do - way of life through martial art).\n<br \/><br \/>The Way of the Eastern Sword, Haedong Kumdo, is an exciting and dynamic martial art.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThis important step done, the practice will intensify.

Here is my proposal for the <em>\"Nomadism &amp; Shedworking\"<\/em> track:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe recent direction of business applications has been centralization to web-based systems, easing deployment, upgrades and management of application security. However, at same time centralization provides new risks like the introduction of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisbrogan.com\/when-google-owns-you\/\">single point of failure<\/a> for application usage and in most cases inability to work offline.\n<br \/><br \/>At the same time, working culture has started so shift more towards networked individuals, or \"web workers\" forming ad-hoc coalitions to work on various projects. For them, centralized applications might not be desirable due to data ownership and infrastructure requirements.\n<br \/><br \/>Moving the applications from centralized web servers to a peer-to-peer network allows web workers to be in control of their own data, stay productive even in unstable connectivity situations, and collaborate easily with their colleagues in an ad-hoc way.\n<br \/><br \/>This talk outlines some ways to move forward in building peer-to-peer networked business applications. There are many open source frameworks targeting the problem, including replicated databases like <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/couchdb\/\">CouchDb<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/syncwith.us\/\">Prophet<\/a>, and application-oriented P2P networks like <a href=\"http:\/\/swallow.sourceforge.net\/\">Swallow\/DBE<\/a>. These will be discussed together with some real-world examples of business applications built with them:\n<br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajatus.info\/\">Ajatus<\/a> - a \"<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.law.harvard.edu\/vrm\/2007\/11\/16\/crm-gets-personal\/\">Personal CRM<\/a>\" built on top of CouchDb, a RESTful replicated object database\n<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/how-openpsa-uses-dbe.html\">OpenPsa<\/a> - project management system <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/finding-resources-automatically-in-openpsa.html\">doing resourcing<\/a> over the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digital-ecosystem.org\/\">DBE<\/a> P2P network\n<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/syncwith.us\/\">Simple Defects<\/a> - a P2P bug tracking system built on top of the Prophet replicated database\n<br \/><br \/>The first phase of P2P business applications will likely be services operating in closed networks of users' social networking or instant messaging contacts. But the P2P model can also provide opportunities for wider networking, making it possible to find new project partners or collaborators anywhere in the world. This wider-ranging business network will introduce new challenges like security and reputation management.

But there is also another way: separating the user interface from the CMS using a CMS-neutral protocol called Neutron.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAccording to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/People\/Berners-Lee\/\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee<\/a>, the earliest web browser was <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/WorldWideWeb#Features\">also an editor<\/a>. And the late 90s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Netscape_Composer\">Netscape Communicator<\/a> followed this ideal by including a HTML editor that could publish changes to pages using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apacheweek.com\/features\/put\">HTTP PUT<\/a> method. But then the idea of editing via the web browser transformed to clunky forms and Java applet -based WYSIWYG editors, brought about by the rise of content management systems.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe problems of the user interface being part of the web page were multiple: it cluttered the produced HTML, it was possible to break by layout changes, sometimes the login and editing options were hard to find. It also meant that each and every CMS would have a completely different user interface. A problem made especially difficult if you had to use multiple systems. For example:\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIf you are <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/profile\/view\/qgil\/\">Quim Gil<\/a>, working for Nokia's <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/\">maemo.org<\/a>, you're living in a world of many, many CMSs. The <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/\">marketing and community parts<\/a> of the website are run by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.maemo.org\/\">documentation wiki<\/a> by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediawiki.org\/\">MediaWiki<\/a>, your <a href=\"http:\/\/flors.wordpress.com\/\">own blog<\/a> by <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a>, and the list goes on. While in this kind of corporate setup it has been possible to mostly unify usernames and passwords, it still means each part of your work runs with different UIs, and different usage logic. Back in 2003, I named this syndrome <a href=\"http:\/\/oscom.org\/projects\/documentation\/midgard\/case-oscom.html\">Frankenstein CMS<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIn addition to consistency and usability, offline editing has been a big issue with most CMSs. In typical situation, it simply doesn't exist, making copy-and-paste way of taking documents with you to edit on a laptop while traveling.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThere have been several initiatives in solving these problems. A quite limited, but so far successful example is the <a href=\"http:\/\/universaleditbutton.org\/Universal_Edit_Button\">Universal Edit Button<\/a> specification, making rounds earlier this summer. The idea is that CMSs would include metadata on where the editing view of a particular page was in the page itself, and then browsers would display a button leading to it. The approach has been adopted by several big players, including Wikipedia, and we also made it a part of the new CMS that will be built on <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_2-more_than_just_php-more_than_just_cms.html\">Midgard 2<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-2accbcb265f511ddae75cb6d513f60396039\/midcom3-ueb.jpg\" height=\"186\" width=\"260\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Universal Edit Button in MidCOM 3\" title=\"Universal Edit Button in MidCOM 3\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>\nAnother, also somewhat limited example is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xmlrpc.com\/metaWeblogApi\">MetaWeblog API<\/a> provided by most blogging platforms. It has enabled vendors to produce great offline blogging software like <a href=\"http:\/\/infinite-sushi.com\/software\/ecto\/\">Ecto<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.red-sweater.com\/marsedit\/\">MarsEdit<\/a> that provide offline editing and work with almost any blogging system out there. As I write this, I'm using Ecto on my MacBook Air, and will later use it to publish this entry to my Midgard server. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc5023.txt\">Atom Publishing Protocol<\/a> will likely be the successor of MetaWeblog, but appears to still keep the blog-only focus.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBack in the earlier days of <a href=\"http:\/\/oscom.org\/\">OSCOM<\/a> we had another initiative called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/projects\/twingle\/\">Twingle<\/a>. It was a XUL-based desktop CMS client that utilized WebDAV and some XML introspection files to edit and publish data on different CMSs. After a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/sprints\/1--zurich-march-2003\/\">March 2003 OSCOM Sprint <\/a>in Zurich we were able to demo the same client browsing and editing resources on three CMSs, including Zope and Midgard. Unfortunately, then CMS market became so hot that vendors were simply too busy to pick this up and the project died.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nLuckily <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wyona.com\/people\/michael-wechner\/index.html\">Michael Wechner<\/a>, of OSCOM and <a href=\"http:\/\/lenya.apache.org\/\">Apache Lenya<\/a> fame didn't let the idea die. He worked it onwards, naming the protocol used for conversation between the client and the server <a href=\"http:\/\/neutron.wyona.org\/\">Neutron Publishing Protocol<\/a>, a play on Atom. He also built a new client, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yulup.org\/index.html\">Yulup<\/a>, as a Firefox extension that could manage content on compatible servers.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-46c28e0665f511ddb69183ca183432173217\/michael_wechner_in_horgenberg.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-4ce43d7a65f511dd9a98255b6b8079727972\/michael_wechner_in_horgenberg-tm.jpg\" height=\"249\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Michael Wechner in Horgenberg\" title=\"Michael Wechner in Horgenberg\" \/><\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIn summer 2007 I saw a demo of Yulup and discussed Neutron with Michi and was impressed. But was back then too depressed by <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/when_a_holiday_gets-interesting.html\">the Czech episode<\/a> and other personal issues to press on with the idea. Having watched another year of the directions the community is taking Midgard CMS to, and how clients view CMS deployments, I'm starting to think the time would be ripe for going full forward with Neutron.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIn nutshell Neutron is a metadata layer that allows a CMS to specify the actions user can take, and the methods provided for those actions. The methods can either be full-blown WebDAV, or simpler GET-and-POST that more limited CMSs can support. Neutron also provides its own authentication mechanism, though I would gladly see that overtaken by  a more secure and widely supported standard like <a href=\"http:\/\/oauth.net\/\">OAuth<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWidely-supported Neutron would provide huge advantages: letting the developers of a CMS to focus on the actual management and presentation layers of the system, and allowing more innovation to happen in the client end due to combined efforts from multiple CMS projects. It would allow building of different content management interfaces for different audiences or usage scenarios. Simple editing and publishing clients that could run fully in browser's AJAX space for casual bloggers or wiki editors, workflow tools for gatekeepers of corporate publishing processes, and full-blown desktop content management tools for site editors. Other special cases like mobile content management could also be provided for.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSo what is needed for this future to become reality? First of all, we need to make CMS developers aware of the possibility. Then we need a killer client that every CMS provider would want to support. And then we can expand the protocol, and build additional clients to cater for special needs.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe big question is how this will happen. Industry groups in CMS space are loose or non-existing, and so they lack the muscle to push any standards. Effort by single CMS vendor would probably stay partisan, as developers of different systems are quite suspicious or ignorant of each other. But maybe a combination of the two would work: industry group, such as OSCOM organizing some compatibility hacking events for the developer community, and a company dedicated at building a killer client application. It warrants serious consideration if <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/\">Nemein<\/a> should be that company.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<em>This manifesto on transforming how CMSs are used was written in an Eurostar London-Brussels train, sipping Dourthe's Bordeaux white and listening to the Karelia cycle by Sibelius.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/some_notes_from_akademy_2008\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Some notes from aKademy 2008","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-08-10 13:19:04","atom:content":"<p>\nI'm currently in <a href=\"http:\/\/akademy.kde.org\/\">aKademy<\/a>, the KDE conference, talking about adding the <a href=\"http:\/\/worrydream.com\/MagicInk\/#inferring_context_from_the_environment\">geographical context<\/a> into the Linux desktop. <a href=\"http:\/\/geoclue.freedesktop.org\/\">GeoClue<\/a>, our solution to this problem is built to be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/\">desktop-agnostic<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/D-Bus\">service<\/a>, and therefore the same talk has been held in both <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/notes_from_guadec_istanbul.html\">GUADEC<\/a> and aKademy.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nHere are some notes from the conference:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>There was quite a good amount of interest in GeoClue.

To quote the <a href=\"http:\/\/greenprogrammer.blogspot.com\/2006\/01\/what-is-green-programming.html\">Green Programming blog<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nJust like we should aspire to use renewable energy sources to help the health of the planet, we should also use reusable software elements to create robust, healthy code for our customers. Eco-friendly practices might be thought of as applicable to software devlopment. Just as we are concerned with the various biota and climate of the planet, we should be concerned with the over-all health of the software eco-system.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nHow does <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> sit in with these ideas? Well, the current version of it does not. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\">MidCOM 2<\/a> is a heavy, enterprise-oriented CMS framework that requires big machines, or even clusters to run.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut things are quite different in <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_2-more_than_just_php-more_than_just_cms.html\">Midgard 2 land<\/a>. We have <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/some_plans_for_midcom_3.html\">rewritten the MidCOM framework<\/a> from scratch, removing the need to have abstractions on top of abstractions to support the shift from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/#9f42c2021f0b0efedacd0ae9d6801c5c\">classic Midgard APIs<\/a> to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/#3855e6325f5459c1d4f3b9863bc7debe\">new ones<\/a>, and from PHP4 to <a href=\"http:\/\/tr2.php.net\/zend-engine-2.php\">more object-oriented PHP versions<\/a>. We have also focused on simplicity and adaptability, to make MidCOM an easier environment <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midcom_3_at_a_glance.html\">to work with<\/a> for site developers.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhile MidCOM3 is not due to be out before next March, <a href=\"http:\/\/teroheikkinen.iki.fi\/\">Tero Heikkinen<\/a>, an early adopter has been building some production sites with it already. And his experiences state that not only the performance is much better, but also it requires much less work from programmers.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nI know <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sitepoint.com\/blogs\/2008\/08\/29\/rasmus-lerdorf-php-frameworks-think-again\/\">Rasmus' argument is that frameworks are evil<\/a> by requiring developers to adopt to their own concepts, and by introducing unnecessary overhead. But we should look beyond mere server-level productivity, and take programmer productivity into account. A framework makes things much easier for agile teams, enabling people with different competences to work in their isolated environments. Programmers can work on the code, and designers on <a href=\"http:\/\/phptal.motion-twin.com\/\">the templates<\/a> for instance.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhile this makes the actual development and deployment process more efficient, how much performance is lost due to the framework?\n<br \/><span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>\n<br \/>Lies, damn lies and benchmarks\n<br \/><\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nLike Rasmus, I used an <a href=\"http:\/\/pecl.php.net\/package\/APC\">APC-cached<\/a> simple PHP \"<em>hello world<\/em>\" file as the baseline for my benchmarks. On my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marco.org\/277\">dog slow MacBook Air<\/a>, the simple PHP file was able to serve <strong>32.91<\/strong> requests per second.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nMidCOM3, when run on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/view\/1219823947.html\">Midgard 8.09<\/a> with APC and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danga.com\/memcached\/\">memcached<\/a> was able to serve <strong>8.90<\/strong> request per second, or in other words performed at 27% of the plain PHP file. Not too good, but considered that much SQL is run to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-host_and_page\/\">serve a Midgard page<\/a>, there are good explanations at this.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut compared to <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/\">Drupal<\/a>, which I did not install but instead calculated <a href=\"http:\/\/talks.php.net\/show\/froscon08\/32\">the performance<\/a> based on the difference between my baseline (32.91 r\/s) and Rasmus' (611.78 r\/s), MidCOM3 was doing quite fine. Drupal would only be serving about <strong>2.5<\/strong> requests per second on my box. <a href=\"http:\/\/framework.zend.com\/\">Zend Framework<\/a>, again calculated from <a href=\"http:\/\/talks.php.net\/show\/froscon08\/29\">Rasmus' data<\/a> would provide <strong>6.5<\/strong> request per second.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAnd this is not all. <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.nemein.com\/people\/piotras\/\">Piotr Pokora<\/a> has done a stellar work with <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_2-more_than_just_php-more_than_just_cms.html\">Midgard2<\/a>, which <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_and_synchronized_releases.html\">will come out in spring<\/a> numbered 9.03. With it, MidCOM's numbers were quite a lot better: <strong>25.37<\/strong> requests per second, or 77% of the simple PHP file's performance. This is actually faster than the same simple PHP file on my box without APC (24.84 r\/s).\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nI believe the MidCOM3 performance story does not end here. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/discussion\/developer-forum\/caching_midgard_requests\/\">Piotras has been doing experiments<\/a> with caching Midgard's initial request data to reduce database queries, and MidCOM3 still misses the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-midcom-specs-subsystems-cache\/\">extensive caching infrastructure<\/a> provided by MidCOM2. When these are in place, we may get pretty damn close to the plain PHP numbers.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSo, with these numbers, I think we can say that Midgard2 will be quite a good framework for doing green programming while still retaining agile team efficiency.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>\n<br \/>Towards a greener future<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis matters quite a lot, as then Midgard can be run with much smaller virtual machines consuming much less electricity to serve interesting information-rich applications.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Ragnaroek gets out in end of September we will start focusing our efforts to the new platform that already is showing so much promise. A brighter, greener, more efficient future lies ahead!\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/knol-a_unit_of_knowledge\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Knol: a unit of knowledge","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-08-29 13:47:07","atom:content":"<p>\nGoogle's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwriteweb.com\/archives\/knol_google_takes_on_wikipedia.php\">Wikipedia competitor<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knol\">Knol<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yugatech.com\/blog\/gooooogle\/knol-launched-day-one-spammin-jammin\/\">launched<\/a> a while back.

And so I <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/midcom\/commit\/1b590f1d9ad9e14dba69bdbe0628cc116935b2d7\">ended up adding<\/a> support for <em>context injectors<\/em> into MidCOM 3.\n<br \/><span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>\n<br \/>What about contexts anyway?\n<br \/><\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midcom\/3.0\/midcom_core\/midcom_core_helpers_context.html\">Context in MidCOM<\/a> is an object that contains all useful information related to the request at hand: arguments, URL, templating information. And the plan is to make it <a href=\"http:\/\/worrydream.com\/MagicInk\/#inferring_context_from_the_environment\">much more<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nContext is the main way for controllers to find out about their environment, and for the templating system to decide which views to run and how. As we want to make the new MidCOM <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/some_thoughts_on_green_programming-php-midgard_and_simplicity.html\">lean and efficient<\/a>, we did not want to stick everything possible into the context. But in order to solve problems developers will need more stuff there. And so the idea of context injectors was born.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nContext injectors are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/discussion\/developer-forum\/some_midcom3_api_changes_to_come\/\">a new API<\/a> components can use to add or modify information in the current context. The injectors will be run in two places:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Process injectors<\/strong> will be called before dispatcher loads the component and calls the controller<\/li>\n<li><strong>Template injectors<\/strong> will be called after controller has finished and before a template is collected and displayed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nThere are many things you can do there. Some immediate use cases are:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the-midgard-position.html\">Geopositioning injector<\/a><\/strong> could add user's <a href=\"http:\/\/google-code-updates.blogspot.com\/2008\/08\/two-new-ways-to-location-enable-your.html\">current location<\/a> to the context so that a controller can fetch nearby data<\/li>\n<li><strong>Theming injector<\/strong> could switch the template entry point (in old Midgard term's the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-page_and_style\/\">ROOT element<\/a>) according to user's wishes<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mobile optimization injector<\/strong> could also switch the template entry point if user is accessing the site with an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/iphone\/\">iPhone<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openmoko.com\/product.html\">OpenMoko<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>\n<br \/>Using context injectors\n<br \/><\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe way this works is relatively simple. To create an injector, you <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-component-development\/\">create a component<\/a> and create an <em>injector class<\/em> to it. Depending which injector you want to provide, you either implement a <em>inject_process<\/em> or <em>inject_template<\/em> public method there. The method will have full access to the current context (in <em>$_MIDCOM-&gt;context<\/em>) and can add or change things there. The just declare that you have the class in the component's manifest by adding a key <em>process_injector<\/em> or <em>template_injector<\/em> with value being the class name.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nMidCOM will take care of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midcom\/3.0\/midcom_core\/midcom_core_component_loader.html\">loading the component<\/a> in question in the right time, and of calling the injector method. This will all happen automatically once the component is installed.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIf your controller or template uses context information that is not part of the default context data, then make sure to first check that the data is available via an <a href=\"http:\/\/tr2.php.net\/isset\">isset()<\/a>. This way your component will be able to work around missing context information if applicable to your scenario, or throw an error.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<em>Written outside in the <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/plazes.com\/plazes\/153563_platonik\">Platonik<\/a><\/em><em> waterpipe cafe in <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Besiktas\">Be\u015fikta\u015f<\/a><\/em><em>, Istanbul, while <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vitis_vinifera\">vine leaves<\/a><\/em><em> above keep the air cool enough for working.

More importantly perhaps, it's produced wonderful progeny. It has spawned hundreds of thousands of free software projects, thousands of free or nearly-free operating systems, and an unbelievably vibrant global free and open source software community. Beyond the software realm, the free culture movement, most free licensing projects, and much of the access to knowledge movement can trace a connection back to GNU. We are living, and building, a new generation of the free software movement.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nAs computers are becoming more and more ubiquitous, and affect more and more every aspect of our lives, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsfeurope.org\/documents\/freesoftware.en.html\">software freedom<\/a> becomes a strong necessity. I personally have been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ohloh.net\/accounts\/bergie\">involved<\/a> with free software since late 90s. It gives me the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.debian.org\/\">operating system<\/a> for our servers, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/\">programming language<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">our toolkit<\/a>. It also gives me an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\">amazing<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsfe.org\/en\/fellows\">community<\/a> to work and share ideas with. It is hard to imagine working in a world without them.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nTo support free software, write <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/\">some code<\/a>, use a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ubuntu.com\/\">free operating system<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsfe.org\/\">join the Fellowship<\/a>, and celebrate <a href=\"http:\/\/softwarefreedomday.org\/\">the Software Freedom Day<\/a> on September 20th!\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/ragnaroek_is_coming\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Ragnaroek is coming","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-09-08 20:15:06","atom:content":"<p>\nWith <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/view\/1220897153.html\">beta2 out today<\/a>, the new Midgard 8.09, or \"Ragnaroek LTS\" is finally coming. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/view\/php4_end-of-life_and_midgard.html\">PHP4 has been dropped<\/a>, many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/discussion\/developer-forum\/for_a_more_efficient_midcom_2-9\/\">optimizations made<\/a>, and now that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kaktus.cc\/weblog\/view\/1220703023\/\">Prototype has been dropped<\/a> in favor of jQuery, I think we will finally be able to live with it as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/discussion\/developer-forum\/what_do_you_expect_from_the_lts_version\/\">Long Term Support<\/a> release.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut before <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/download\/8-9.html\">Ragnaroek<\/a> is stable a lot of testing has to happen, as should polishing here and there. <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.nemein.com\/people\/piotras\/\">Piotras<\/a> is fixing the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/site_creation_wizard_runs.html\">site wizard<\/a>, and I've been adding more information about the installed components.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nUnlike <a href=\"http:\/\/ez.no\/ezcomponents\">eZComponents<\/a> which are just libraries, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-component-development\/\">components in Midgard<\/a> are the building blocks of a website. Each of them is its own PHP application that the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\">MidCOM MVC framework<\/a> runs when a folder associated with that component is accessed. They all supply their own templates, localizations, and load whatever libraries needed. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently we have some 120 components in <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/browser\/trunk\/midcom\">the MidCOM repository<\/a>, and most of them have releases on the <a href=\"http:\/\/pear.midcom-project.org\/\">PEAR channel<\/a>. The components range from simple things like a news listing to very specific applications like event registration or invoice processing.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nOne way to make components more visual was to add icons for them.

Could it be just that iPhone has faster processor, and uses <a href=\"http:\/\/webkit.org\/\">WebKit<\/a> instead of Mozilla? But at the same time, the state-of-the-art <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/firefox\/\">Firefox 3<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/tags\/macbookair\/\">my MacBook Air<\/a> was also feeling sluggish.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAfter giving this a little bit of thought, I decided, Flash must be the guilty party. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adobe_Flash\">Flash<\/a>, as we know, is Adobe's proprietary framework for building multimedia-rich applications, and iPhone simply <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tuaw.com\/2007\/06\/12\/its-official-no-flash-support-on-the-iphone-yet\/\">doesn't support it<\/a>. Sometimes Flash is actually used for building interesting applications, but most usage online seems to be just fancy animated banners. So, I thought, there must be a smart way to get rid of Flash. And there is: With Firefox you can use the <a href=\"http:\/\/flashblock.mozdev.org\/\">FlashBlock extension<\/a> to excise all Flash content off the pages:\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-fb7c0a989dfe11ddbd57458be9cc09f609f6\/arstechnica-with-flashblock.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-ff88725c9dfe11dd83b943f4337535593559\/arstechnica-with-flashblock-tm.jpg\" height=\"224\" width=\"398\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Arstechnica with Flashblock\" title=\"Arstechnica with Flashblock\" \/><\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWith other browsers you could off course uninstall the Flash plug-in, but the problem is that sometimes there is Flash content you actually want to see. And in these cases FlashBlock works perfectly: each Flash area on a site is replaced with a box that you can activate at will. So before <a href=\"http:\/\/ostatic.com\/172399-blog\/chrome-javascript-and-flash-two-mostly-opposing-views\">Flash is made obsolete<\/a> by the recent <a href=\"http:\/\/webkit.org\/blog\/140\/html5-media-support\/\">advancements in HTML<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pathf.com\/blogs\/2008\/08\/faster-javascript-for-firefox-31-thru-jit\/\">Javascript<\/a>, this option is the best of both worlds.\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/decss-legal_or_illegal\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"DeCSS, legal or illegal?","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-10-23 12:56:05","atom:content":"<p>\nWhile last year Finnish courts decided that <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/news.ars\/post\/20070525-finland-court-breaking-ineffective-copy-protection-is-permissible.html\">breaking ineffective copy protection is legal<\/a>, it seems this year the ruling <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitoday.fi\/yhteiskunta\/2008\/10\/22\/lex-karpelaa-vastustanut-tuomittiin\/200827563\/66\">has been reversed<\/a>.

We hacked it together with <a href=\"http:\/\/jukkaz.wordpress.com\/\">@jlz<\/a> in Helsinki Capital of Culture offices in Etelaranta at night time.\n<br \/><br \/>Before Midgard, the site had run on a SGML pipelines -based publishing system we called SusiSGML, and member registry on some custom Perl stuff. Then we wanted more dynamic functionality, and Midgard was born. At first @jlz was intending to write it in Scheme, but then chose the C+PHP extension.\n<br \/><br \/>For administration, we wrote the \u201cMidgard Admin\u201d tool, traces of which can still be seen in SpiderAdmin.\n<br \/><br \/>Midgard was intended to be a one-off, but then as my employer Stonesoft clearly needed some system I deployed there. Then @jlz was hired to my team, and we decided to open source Midgard before any IPR issues would rise with our employer, which was after all a proprietary software vendor.\n<br \/><br \/>When the original Midgard-based Grey Wolves site launched in early 99, we had the great example of what things can be: Hiiden Hirven Hiihto photos and reportage were live only couple of hours after the event ended.

It should be a vision everybody in the community can agree with, and a vision that will benefit the user base.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nI believe that \"<a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard2_at_fscons-your_data-everywhere\/\">your data, everywhere<\/a>\" is the right idea. We should target Midgard for the replicated world where your application data can be easily transferred between multiple devices, served on the web, and shared with your friends.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhile some believe that soon you will \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.37signals.com\/svn\/posts\/347-youre-not-on-a-fucking-plane-and-if-you-are-it-doesnt-matter\">never be offline<\/a>\", I think that level of ubiquitous connectivity is either unattainable or at least very far off in the future. What we need instead is to be able to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the_old_offline_vs-online_debate\/\">have our data with us, wherever we go<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Unique visual identity<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat really sets Apple's products apart is the \"fit and finish,\" the ultimate impression that results from thousands of tiny decisions that go into a product's development. Take Apple's pioneering work in injection molding. It's part science, part art, and plenty of trial and error.  (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/magazine\/content\/06_39\/b4002414.htm\">Who Is Jonathan Ive?<\/a>)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nDesign is often what differentiates winners from the mass. Apple's beautiful laptops and cell phones are a good example of how you can beat a crowded market by focusing on design and details.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhile we should have distinctive visual elements to build our user interfaces from, I don't mean only that. By design I mean that we really need to think hard of what our users need, and design beautiful interfaces that make things easy for them.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nOn the visual end, the Midgard colors of grey, orange and brown should stand out quite well. We have excellent icons done in the <a href=\"http:\/\/tango.freedesktop.org\/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines\">Tango style<\/a>, and many other design elements coming from Ilkka Martio's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/quimgil\/481034884\/\">work on Midgard2 styling<\/a>. These should be cornerstones of the new visual user interface. In '99 Midgard had a strong, <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/1107841998\/\">distinctive visual identity<\/a>. We need to rebuild that.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Content management<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nContent management: This is the everything that happens with a piece of content after its created and until it dies. This includes the permissions, workflows, versioning, check in\/out, task management, reporting, archiving, administrative searching, language translation, and any other action involved in keeping this content relevant, current, effective, and general under control. (<a href=\"http:\/\/gadgetopia.com\/post\/6186\">The Four Disciplines of Content Management<\/a>)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_vikings_and_free_software\/\">Midgard's origins<\/a> have been in <a href=\"http:\/\/gadgetopia.com\/post\/252\">web publishing<\/a>, and through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/Feature\/48-Midgard-1.4\">strong templating<\/a> and component systems this is where we've been quite good at. But content management we haven't done that well. At least, if content management is taken to a wider meaning than just \"making stuff editable and published on the web\".\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWith the new Midgard we have the delightful opportunity to rethink this all. Thanks to our active consulting companies and the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midcom_3_at_a_glance\/\">powerful MVC framework<\/a> we shouldn't focus on actual components this time - they will appear for sure through various client projects. Instead, we should concentrate on the basic ideas of content management.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis means that we should think of how the content is actually edited and published, and how it lives on in a service. Handling and connecting of content fragments, managing inter-document linkage, and versioning are all important features. Similarly, we should make it easy to send documents to commenting and approval rounds, and to serve them in multiple variants.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAn important piece for this would be making the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/notification-management-in-openpsa-2\/\">notification service<\/a> that in older Midgard existed as a separate component an integral part of the system. Any Midgard application should be able to store and show notifications for users. If this is utilized from core up, then workflow between different parties working on a site or a document will be much easier.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nTo ensure consistency between components, and that components are as easy to develop as possible, MidCOM should provide a good set of controller baseclasses for typical content management activities.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Replication everywhere<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nBefore his retirement as Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates suggested that a so-called pervasive desktop would be a focus of Windows 7, giving users a way to take all their data, desktop settings, bookmarks, and the like from one computer to another--presumably as long as all those computers were running Windows 7. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/152683-4\/15_hot_new_technologies_that_will_change_everything.html\">PC World<\/a>)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nEven though Midgard has supported replication since 2000, it has always been a bit of an extra feature. Most installations have still been on the server end, with the server acting as an isolated island.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nFollowing our \"<a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard2_at_fscons-your_data-everywhere\/\">your data, everywhere<\/a>\" vision, this must change. Replication tools must be shipped with every Midgard installation, be it on server, on desktop, or on a mobile device. And they must be integrated with the user interfaces. Anywhere you edit something, you should be able to share it with others, and see where that piece of content originally came from, and who it has been shared with.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWhen online, the sharing and synchronization must happen instantly. When offline, the changes to be replicated must be collected into a local spool, and then sent over when connectivity is available.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Separating content objects from internal objects<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n...load-bearing walls in content management \u2014 those things that require a content editor to call a developer to change them. Where do you draw the boundaries? (<a href=\"http:\/\/gadgetopia.com\/post\/6313\">Load-Bearing Walls in Content Management<\/a>)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nEverything in Midgard is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema-in-php\/\">an MgdSchema object<\/a>, be it permission, site template, user, or an article. This is good in the sense that it allows familiar programming interfaces to be used on every level of the system. But it also means that internal objects sometimes end up being used as content objects, causing confusion.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nFor instance, persons and groups are often used as on-site content. But they differ from other pieces of content on many levels, for instance because they have so many other objects connected to them through permissions and metadata. Because of this they work with different rules regarding to deletion and approval than others, which many users can find frustrating.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWe should see to have stronger differentiation between content objects of different types to ensure smoother usage and replication.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Quality<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nQuality criterias - Portability: Easy to configure in new environments, Few OS and webserver dependencies, Few and documented version dependencies (language version, database version, external libraries), Able to survive environment updates (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/mayflowergmbh\/quality-in-php-projects-beyond-unittests-presentation?type=powerpoint\">Quality in PHP Projects Beyond Unittests<\/a>)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nLike many other pieces of free software, Midgard has been riddled by quality issues. While our bugs haven't meant gaping security holes, changing APIs and memory leaks have caused many grey hairs to our users.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nTo improve quality in the Midgard software stack we have already taken some steps. The new <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_and_synchronized_releases\/\">synchronized release model<\/a> ensures that Midgard and MidCOM play well together and that component developers can start using new interfaces and features more quickly. It also makes Midgard more predictable to users, helping them to plan their upgrades well ahead.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/build.opensuse.org\/\">openSUSE Build Service<\/a> has also increased the quality of Midgard software. Now we can provide prebuilt binaries to most popular Linux distributions, making installing and upgrading Midgard easier. The new datagard tool makes setting up a Midgard site <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/long-term_support_for_midgard-ragnaroek_is_here\/\">a single shell command<\/a>, which is also an important step here. In the future we should aim also for the virtualized systems by using tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.susestudio.com\/\">SUSE Studio<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nQuality and backwards compatibility of commits is also important, as are coding standards in a major project like this. To that end, our new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/discussion\/developer-forum\/proposal-new_midcom_commit_policy\/\">VCS Tyrant<\/a> should be able to help our contributors in their work. Similarly, the <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/roadmap\">newly-revitalized issue tracker<\/a> with its clear milestones make tracking the development work easier.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nFinally, better software testing is a major step to strive for. Regressions have hurt us in the past, and the only way to get rid of them is to to implement a good test suite. For this, we will have an unit testing workshop on the first day of the Gathering.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Documentation<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nIf our intent is to encourage people to use these tools and to contribute their time to the development of these tools, we need to spend more energy on introductory documentation. Engineers who look at Sourceforge are looking either for solutions to problems or are looking for interesting tools. In either case the Web site needs to convey the important details in a short form to enable the reader to gauge their level of interest. Obscurity in documentation benefits no one as it annoys potential users and non-users alike. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.devx.com\/opensource\/Article\/11839\">Is Documentation Holding Open Source Back?<\/a>)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nMidgard's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/\">documentation wiki<\/a> is currently in a horrible shape. As Midgard's capabilities have grown, and versions changed, new stuff has been added. But all of the old stuff is also there. And users, stumbling there either through the navigation or a google search, will have few ways to tell whether a document is up-to-date.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nDevelopers clearly feel this frustration, and as result much of the newer documentation, especially for Midgard2 is available only <a href=\"http:\/\/teroheikkinen.iki.fi\/blog\/view\/some_documentation_about_installing_midgard_2.html\">in blog format<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBecause of this, we really need to put an effort to improving the level of documentation. And important first step would be to take the current wiki content into control. Old information must be either removed or tagged to the version it belongs. Templates must be tuned so that they show clearly if something is current or historical information. And the new materials must be collected from the various blogs in order to be published on the site.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAfter this is done we must rethink the way the wiki is maintained. Maybe we need a \"documentation master\" just like we now have a \"bug master\" and a \"VCS tyrant\". Maybe we must switch <a href=\"http:\/\/midgardwiki.contentcontrol-berlin.de\/index.php\/Main_Page\">to MediaWiki<\/a>. Or maybe we must make the wiki a replicated system that we all can run and edit also on our own machines. As I am not quite sure of the right solution this must be discussed well in the Gathering.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Virtual servers<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nOne of the more successful technologies to have been developed is virtualization. Broadly speaking, to virtualize is to make a single piece of hardware function as multiple pieces. Different user interfaces isolate portions of the hardware, and make each one operate as a separate entity. As applied to data centers, installing virtual infrastructure allows more operating systems and applications to run on fewer servers, which reduces overall energy use and cooling requirements. (<a href=\"http:\/\/ecopreneurist.com\/2008\/02\/07\/virtualization-a-boon-for-green-computing\/\">Ecopreneurist<\/a>)\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIn the past Midgard has been hurt much by the fact that root access is required. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensourcecms.com\/\">Less advanced content management systems<\/a> have surpassed us in popularity by many orders of magnitude because anybody can set them up in just some web space.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut now I believe things are changing. Virtual servers are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and as they allow much larger degree of freedom than shared web hosting, companies and even individuals are now buying them instead. And on a virtual server you can run Midgard easily.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIf we want to really benefit from the wide popularity of virtual servers, we must take some steps. First of all, Midgard must be very easy to install, as it is now thanks to datagard and OBS. And secondly, we should provide preconfigured \"<a href=\"http:\/\/susestudio.com\/\">virtual appliance<\/a>\" images that hosting providers running Xen or VMware can set up just as easily as they would an off-the-shelf Debian or RHEL.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe replicated network setup should also take this into account. Users should be able to easily keep adding new virtual servers into their cluster and have that instantly <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard2-future_in_the_clouds\/\">start sharing data with their other servers<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/summer_versus_autumn_identity\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Summer versus autumn identity","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2008-10-31 17:41:15","atom:content":"<p>\nAs I didn't go to <a href=\"http:\/\/latinoware.org\/\">LatinoWare<\/a> this year, the extended summer is now officially over, and therefore it is time to change to autumn garb, also on my online identity.

As an example of how innovation used to happen, he dug up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eyewitnesstohistory.com\/ford.htm\">Henry Ford's early automobiles and assembly lines<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWith these early Fords, the customer choice was limited to having your car \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.metafilter.com\/75290\/Any-color-so-long-as-its-black\">in any color as long as it is black<\/a>\". And judging how since then cars have diversified to come in so many different forms, specialities and colors, this thinking must be flawed, no?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/radar.oreilly.com\/2008\/11\/a-critical-choice-regarding-innovation.html\">As Tim O'Reilly pointed out<\/a>, JP Rangaswami's blog talks about enhancing the consumer experience in markets that are already out there and are mature. In less established fields, the lone inventor must still press on:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nIn a talk I attended many years ago, Joseph Campbell said that the Knights of the Round Table were the archetypal myth of Western civilization, the idea that each of us, alone, must go off into the deepest, darkest part of the forest, populated by monsters, on a quest to make the world a better place.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nAn interesting comparison with Ford at another, still quite immature and emerging field is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/\">Apple<\/a>. Apple provides a full range of computers from servers to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/iphone\/\">mobile phones<\/a> and in most cases <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmonkey.com\/blog\/iPhone_App_Store_Exclusivity_Is_a_Big_Drawback\">seeks to control<\/a> the experience through the whole way. The devices are beautifully designed and work well as long as you use them as intended, and not for anything else.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis is a big contrast to the rest of the computing world, where everything comes with a bewildering <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/windows-vista\/compare-editions\/default.aspx\">number of choices<\/a>. And these choices rarely work so well with each other. And so Apple is able to utilize their singular vision and attention to detail to make very <a href=\"http:\/\/www.roughlydrafted.com\/2007\/12\/14\/canalys-symbian-apple-iphone-already-leads-windows-mobile-in-us-market-share-q3-2007\/\">good business<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIn the free software world, the same distinction has traditionally been between the GNOME and KDE projects. GNOME has focused on a controlled environment with <a href=\"http:\/\/live.gnome.org\/UsabilityProject\">strong usability<\/a> and accessibility, while KDE has been about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linux.com\/feature\/142661\">freedom to tinker and configure<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAt some point users will want to manifest their personality or a tribal identity through how they set up their computers. But at the moment I believe we still need more the working systems that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deepjiveinterests.com\/2007\/11\/17\/it-just-works-my-ass\/\">we can use<\/a>, don't have to spend too much time configuring, and that let us focus on whatever we want to accomplish.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis is what originally drove me from my HP Linux laptop to an iBook four years ago. When I ran Linux I found myself constantly tweaking settings and installing new interesting applications that were supposed to improve my life. With Mac, once some basic necessities had been set up, I have very rarely touched any settings.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nNow the iPhone experience has got me to <a href=\"http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/5086490\/the-best-way-to-tether-your-iphone-to-your-laptop-for-free\">feel the downsides<\/a> of Apple's total control, and I'm again looking over the fence to see if free software is greener on the other side. While with Linux I would have full control of my environment, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.markshuttleworth.com\/archives\/150\">whole synchronized release business<\/a> keep things fresh enough. Given that a <a href=\"http:\/\/live.gnome.org\/ReleasePlanning\/TimeBased\">new GNOME<\/a> desktop and a <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.ubuntu.com\/TimeBasedReleases\">new Ubuntu<\/a> would be out in just a few months, I should be able to fight the urge to start upgrading bits and pieces on my own, ruining productivity and potentially breaking my work environment.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIf <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codingmonkeys.de\/subethaedit\/\">SubEthaEdit<\/a> wasn't <a href=\"http:\/\/crschmidt.livejournal.com\/259345.html\">locking me to OS X<\/a>, I would definitely be trying this out.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>As an afterthought<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAll this talk of Ford got me to think a little about the car problem. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.butterpaper.com\/editorials\/editorial201101.htm\">Cars make cities unlivable<\/a> and pollute the world, but at the same time they let people accomplish and experience things that they couldn't without personal transport.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nNow the conventional thinking seems to be that what the world needs is more energy efficient, cleaner cars. But to my point of view, that is quite close to what <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikiquote.org\/wiki\/Henry_Ford\">Ford said<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nIf I'd asked people what they wanted, they'd have said \"faster horses\"\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nSo how about solving the problem in some other way? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/is-this-the-future-of-transport-618967.html\">Segways tried<\/a> and failed to make mobility more even more personal and less space-requiring - but not very appealing in chilly <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/3034692266\/\">Helsinki weather<\/a>.

Back in 1932, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zpub.com\/notes\/idle.html\">Bertrand Russel wrote<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure, they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe whole <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nseries.com\/index.html\">N series of devices<\/a> seems dedicated for allowing you to take that active part: decent cameras, video recording capability, reasonably good keyboards. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macseven.com\/files\/20070610_dvorak_warns_the_iphone_keyboard_sucks.html\">Not so<\/a> with the iPhone.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWith Apple, you're given the role of a consumer: browser the web, watch videos, buy music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.defectivebydesign.org\/blog\/1044\">from huge corporations<\/a>. Just <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsf.org\/blogs\/community\/why-free-software-and-apples-iphone-dont-mix\">don't think different<\/a>. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nComparing my <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/moblog\/photo\/9d36d4cc5cdb11dd9fbb61c594d0dd9edd9e\/\">current iPhone<\/a> and previous N95, on the Nokia I uploaded a bit more data than I downloaded, on the iPhone, I've downloaded ten times more than uploaded. With difficult text input and no background applications, the device simply seems to push users into the consumer mindset.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nTwo years ago we handled the whole <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deathmonkey.org\/\">Death Monkey Rally<\/a> experience using three Nseries phones. They took <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/sets\/72157594264762462\/\">our pictures<\/a> and video, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deathmonkey.org\/archive\/month\/2006\/7.html\">all blog entries<\/a> were written and published with them, and they recorded our stories to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deathmonkey.org\/view\/fifteen-minutes-of-fame.html\">the YleX radio show<\/a>.

It provides an object-oriented and replicated environment for building data-intensive applications.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe theme was expanded further in <a href=\"http:\/\/fscons.org\/\">FSCONS<\/a> when we started describing our vision of enabling users to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard2_at_fscons-your_data-everywhere\/\">have their data with them, at any time, and on any device<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nIn addition to the new communications, we also clarified the release process by joining the larger <a href=\"http:\/\/www.markshuttleworth.com\/archives\/150\">free software release synchronicity movement<\/a>. From autumn 2008 onwards, there will be <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_and_synchronized_releases\/\">a stable Midgard release happening every six months<\/a>, followed with smaller bug fix or feature enhancement releases.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe first release to follow this new pattern was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/8.09\/\">Midgard 8.09 Ragnaroek<\/a>, a <a href=\"http:\/\/teroheikkinen.iki.fi\/blog\/what_are_the_keypoints_of_business_value_generation_with_long_term_support\/\">long-term supported<\/a> release that will be the last generation to include the old <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/reference\/#9f42c2021f0b0efedacd0ae9d6801c5c\">Midgard 1.x codebase<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nTo make <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation\/\">Midgard installation<\/a> easier, we also started using the <a href=\"https:\/\/build.opensuse.org\/\">openSUSE Build Service<\/a>, which enables us to provide <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation-distros\/\">binary packages to many popular Linux platforms<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:14pt;\"><strong>Leaner and meaner Midgard<\/strong><\/span>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nA lot of focus was also put into making Midgard <a href=\"http:\/\/teroheikkinen.iki.fi\/blog\/how_much_more_torque_midcom_3_really_gives\/\">run faster<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/some_thoughts_on_green_programming-php-midgard_and_simplicity\/\">on less resources<\/a>.

Once the case has been proven with the initial participating systems, we will then help other CMS projects to implement the same stack in order to set off a wave of semantically-enhanced websites across the Europe.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nFor us in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a> community this is well-timed, as we're anyway concentrating much effort on the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_2-more_than_just_php-more_than_just_cms\/\">new \"Vinland\" series<\/a> in order to build a set of content management tools that can carry us through the next ten years of web evolution, as the old Midgard series did <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxtoday.com\/developer\/1999050701705NWSW\">since 1999<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe project will be a good chance to leverage our experiences with <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/getting-started-with-microformats\/\">Microformats<\/a> and apply them to the \"uppercase semantic web\".

Last week, I took a new look at it as <a href=\"http:\/\/grep.codeconsult.ch\/\">Bertrand Delacretaz<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.day.com\/content\/day\/en.html\">Day<\/a> held a JCR presentation in the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/starting_the_interactive_knowledge_project\/\">Interactive Knowledge Consortium meeting<\/a>. And you know what? <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Midgard_(software)\">Midgard<\/a> and JCR resemble each other quite a lot:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>Both follow a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spectrum-systems.com\/white_papers\/wp_repository_centric_ea.pdf\">repository-centric<\/a> approach, where the content repository is the point of integration between different tools and applications, with signals flying to inform about actions performed. In JCR this is done with Java events, and in Midgard with <a href=\"http:\/\/teroheikkinen.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_workshop_at_fscons\/\">D-Bus signals<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Both are tree-based, enabling objects to be accessed either via their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema-method-get_by_path\/\">path in the tree<\/a>, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/development\/mrfc\/0018\/\">UUID<\/a>, or various queries. With JCR, the queries are typically <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.gxdeveloperweb.com\/confluence\/display\/GXDEV\/XPath+JCR+Sample+Queries\">XPath<\/a>, while with Midgard there is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgardquerybuilder\/\">Query Builder<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Both also provide a reasonably simple way to define new data types. In JCR's case the <a href=\"http:\/\/jackrabbit.apache.org\/node-type-notation.html\">Node Type Notation<\/a> has a somewhat Ruby-like syntax, while <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema-file\/\">Midgard's MgdSchema<\/a> uses XML. Unstructured data is supported in both by extending the content objects with additional attributes.<\/li>\n<li>Both provide the notion of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nabble.com\/JCR-workspace-usage-td3893800.html\">workspace<\/a>, an ability to have multiple \"virtual repositories\" within one installation. In Midgard, this was originally implemented to support easier hosting and is called \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/concepts-sitegroups\/\">Sitegroups<\/a>\".<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nThere are some important differences, though:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>JCR is a <a href=\"http:\/\/jcp.org\/en\/jsr\/detail?id=170\">Java-centric specification<\/a>, with <a href=\"http:\/\/jackrabbit.apache.org\/\">Apache Jackrabbit<\/a> acting as the reference implementation. Midgard has only <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/download\/\">one implementation<\/a>, but with bindings to multiple programming languages like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/python_midgard\/\">Python<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/mgdschema-in-php\/\">PHP<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/jaiku.com\/channel\/midgard\/presence\/52080041\">C#<\/a>, allowing developers to work with the tools they are familiar with. Midgard APIs could of course be reimplemented natively in any of the languages, as was done with pure-PHP <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Midgard_Lite\">Midgard-Lite<\/a> years ago.<\/li>\n<li>In JCR, everything is stored in a single content tree. In Midgard, the content tree can be multi-rooted, and there can be \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/discussion\/developer-forum\/mgdschema_dependent_objects\/\">independent<\/a>\" objects that exist outside the tree hierarchy.<\/li>\n<li>The JCR specification allows for version control, which in Midgard is handled using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom-services-rcs\/\">external tools<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Midgard supports <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php-midgard_replicator\/\">content replication<\/a>, which JCR does not.<\/li>\n<li>Midgard handles <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgard-and-multilingual-content\/\">internationalization of content objects<\/a> as part of its API, but does not support multivalued properties as JCR does. To bridge this gap between the two repository APIs, I have posted <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/search?q=jcr&amp;noquickjump=1&amp;ticket=on\">a series of feature requests<\/a> to Midgard's tracker.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nEven with these differences, Midgard and JCR remain surprisingly similar on the conceptual level. It would be an interesting experiment to finally create the Midgard-JCR bindings that <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/jukka_back_from_hiatus__jcr_for_midgard\/\">Jukka Zitting started long time ago<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10px;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/jcr\" rel=\"tag\">jcr<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/midgard\" rel=\"tag\">midgard<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/repository\" rel=\"tag\">repository<\/a><\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/tracking_impact_instead_of_effort\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Tracking impact instead of effort","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2009-02-10 08:07:14","atom:content":"<p>\nFrom the bubble-era start-up times in 2001, <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/\">Nemein<\/a> has based its invoicing on hours used, as is typical in the software consulting industry. The company provides services on a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">100% pure, organic free software stack<\/a>, and therefore there are no other additional costs beside maintenance on top of the normal work hours used for a client's benefit.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWith some clients we invoice as we go, and with others everything is based on tight budgeted amounts of hours. However, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.well.com\/~doctorow\/metacrap.htm\">Cory Doctorow's 2001 essay<\/a> on the utopia of Semantic Web reminds, humans are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.well.com\/~doctorow\/metacrap.htm#2.4\">notoriusly bad<\/a> at estimating the time something will take, and so often the resolution of a full or half hour is too strict for accurate estimation.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis, and the tediousness of time tracking has kept me looking for a better way. And such a way presented itself when having some discussions over coffee and cognac at a dinner party held in the <a href=\"http:\/\/nds2.ir.nokia.com\/EUROPE_NOKIA_COM_3\/r2\/aboutnokia\/downloads\/brochures\/pdf\/nokia_manor\/NOKIA_MANOR.pdf\">Nokia Manor<\/a>: how about stopping obsessing about strict amount of hours, and starting to use a bit more flexible model?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nFollowing the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Getting_Things_Done\">Getting Things Done<\/a> doctrine of allowing only \"<a href=\"http:\/\/onlinepersonalassistant.com\/make-everything-an-actionable-task\/\">actionable<\/a>\" tasks, we would split every project into a group of tasks, each provided with a ballpark estimate labeled with terms common from the clothes industry:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>S<\/strong>: small, simple tasks that can be accomplished in around one hour<\/li>\n<li><strong>M<\/strong>: tasks requiring a bit more concentration that often take around half a day<\/li>\n<li><strong>L<\/strong>: tasks requiring lots of focus<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nWe could've taken this to extremes and allowed XXL tasks, but again, to keep things actionable, it is better to split larger efforts into more manageable chunks.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nMoving away from strict definitions of time used also would allow us to do something quite appealing: estimate the impact of a given task, the benefit a client will receive from it, and use that as the basis of invoicing.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nOf course, this all will not free us completely from the evils of hour reporting. Finnish employment law requires us to keep track of working hours to make sure overtime is compensated, and many of the freelancers working with us bill us by the hour. But now this hour reporting will be greatly simplified as you can just \"clock in and out\" at the start and end of the working day instead of trying to keep track of various half hour bits and pieces. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAnd instead of tracking how much time we've spent at the office, we can start measuring the tasks accomplished for our clients.

This means we can already do simple semantic queries like \"<a href=\"http:\/\/search.yahoo.com\/search;_ylt=A0geu5FiYppJyx0AXotXNyoA?p=bergius+searchmonkeyid%3Acom.yahoo.page.uf.geo+helsinki&amp;y=Search&amp;fr=\">pages mentioning Bergius in the Helsinki area<\/a>\":\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-2242647afcc711ddaaf0553a9056a9e2a9e2\/yahoo-semantic-geo-query.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-23e97e12fcc711dda31497b2eec4cd17cd17\/yahoo-semantic-geo-query-tm.jpg\" height=\"295\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Yahoo! semantic geo query\" title=\"Yahoo! semantic geo query\" \/><\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nActually, the Yahoo! results are quite interesting:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/\">My web page<\/a> (which shows my current location, so it may depend on time indexed)<\/li>\n<li>Some Chinese(?) spam site that syndicates my content, proving that also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.well.com\/~doctorow\/metacrap.htm#2.1\">in the Semantic Web people lie<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Some <a href=\"http:\/\/plazes.com\/users\/7006\">Plazes entries<\/a> about me located in Helsinki<\/li>\n<li>Midgard events held <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/events\/midgard_gathering_2008\/\">near Helsinki<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\nSince search engines (well, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/\">Google<\/a> really) are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cabel.name\/2008\/03\/japan-urls-are-totally-out.html\">the way people access the web<\/a>, search engines are the key for making semantic information more widely available. Just look at <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.unto.net\/web\/a-survey-of-rel-values-on-the-web\/\">DeWitt Clinton's survey of rel values<\/a> from yesterday: <a href=\"http:\/\/googleblog.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/preventing-comment-spam.html\">Google-defined<\/a> <code>rel=\"nofollow\"<\/code> is the most popular <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whatwg.org\/specs\/web-apps\/current-work\/#linkTypes\">rel value<\/a> out there, even surpassing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/REC-html40\/present\/styles.html#h-14.3\">style sheet declarations<\/a>.

He reasons that:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n...GNOME developers are not \u201cweb-enabled\u201d. We\u2019re a bit like Microsoft in the early 90s: We focus on the local computer and ignore the internet.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nwhich, to my experience is somewhat true. I went to <a href=\"http:\/\/guadec.org\/\">GUADEC<\/a> for the first time in <a href=\"http:\/\/2003.guadec.org\/\">Dublin in 2003<\/a>, with the specific mission of promoting integration between desktop applications and the various open source web tools like CMSs and CRMs. However, nobody really seemed interested at the time. Only now that cloud has been hyped for a long time, people are paying attention.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, just integrating with Google's services is not enough for free software to do. Let me post a slide from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/bergie\/midgard-2-the-cloud-you-can-control-presentation\">Midgard 2 - The cloud you can control<\/a> presentation in <a href=\"http:\/\/fscons.org\/2008\/\">last FSCONS<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-bf19dfca000611deb6585fecd7c8c748c748\/firefox-cloud-fscons.jpg\" height=\"299\" width=\"398\" border=\"1\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"Firefox, the only relevant free software in the cloud\" title=\"Firefox, the only relevant free software in the cloud\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard2_at_fscons-your_data-everywhere\/\">point we were making<\/a> there was:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n...<a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/technology\/2008\/sep\/29\/cloud.computing.richard.stallman\">the cloud is a trap<\/a> that will move your data, and your applications beyond your control to proprietary data servers and web applications run by multinational corporations. If free software <a href=\"http:\/\/itmanagement.earthweb.com\/osrc\/article.php\/3760206\/Free+and+Open+Source+Software+vs.+Cloud+Computing.htm\">doesn't provide<\/a> a compelling answer to that, we risk irrelevance.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe answer?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nUsers flock to the cloud for two primary reasons: collaboration and convenience. Most \"cloud apps\" allow users to share data with each other and work collaboratively. From the <a href=\"http:\/\/sugarlabs.org\/go\/Main_Page\">Sugar<\/a> project, GNOME already <a href=\"http:\/\/telepathy.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Tubes\">has technology for that<\/a>, if it only was integrated in more applications.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nConvenience means that you can access and manage your data from anywhere, using your own device. It means not being tied to a desktop computer somewhere in your home or office. For that, we suggested that <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard2_at_fscons-your_data-everywhere\/\">Midgard2 could provide a solution<\/a>: \n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nA replicated, peer-to-peer system of synchronizing and sharing your data could be the answer. And <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.nemein.com\/people\/piotras\/view\/midgard2---flexibility-rocks.html\">Midgard2 is a framework<\/a> providing just that. Bindings to different languages like PHP, Python and Mono, interprocess communications via D-Bus and XMPP, replication, and ability to run the same software from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswatch.com\/Trends\/163-Midgard-in-Action\">big server clusters<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/maemo_and_midgard_go_well_together\/\">Nokia internet tablets<\/a> should all help us get there.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIf applications used Midgard's <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_and_jcr-a_look_at_two_content_repositories\/\">content repository<\/a> for their data storage needs, it would be easy to synchronize the data between the user's all devices, and also make it accessible on the web thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midcom_3_at_a_glance\/\">Midgard's web roots<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10px;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/dbus\" rel=\"tag\">dbus<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/freesoftware\" rel=\"tag\">freesoftware<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/gnome\" rel=\"tag\">gnome<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/p2p\" rel=\"tag\">p2p<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/cloud\" rel=\"tag\">cloud<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/tag\/telepathy\" rel=\"tag\">telepathy<\/a><\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/making_the_gnome_desktop_location-aware\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Making the GNOME desktop location-aware","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2009-02-26 13:11:00","atom:content":"<p>\nTo make the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/\">GNOME<\/a> desktop more user-friendly we should <a href=\"http:\/\/worrydream.com\/MagicInk\/#inferring_context_from_the_environment\">utilize context information<\/a> in more places.

About interesting ideas, and the opinions and clarifications to those. About discovering things happening around you.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut to be honest, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/\">Twitter<\/a> and its clones like <a href=\"http:\/\/identi.ca\/\">Identi.ca<\/a> do not do that so well. Ease of posting, and good external tools might be there, but what lacks is the possibility to have real conversations. That is where <a href=\"http:\/\/jaiku.com\/\">Jaiku<\/a> has been shining: the original posts follow the traditional microblogging concept of conversation starters being limited to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Short_message_service\">SMS<\/a>-like 140 characters. But responses to those are not limited similarly, allowing thoughtful commentary to be written.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThat is something that simply doesn't happen on Twitter: <em>thoughtful discussion<\/em>. The poor <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2008\/05\/how-replies-work-on-twitter-and-how.html\">threading model<\/a>, and lack of differentiation between conversation starters and comments simply means everybody ends up shouting on top of each other.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/brightkite.com\/\">Brightkite<\/a>, a location-aware microblogging service almost gets there. It differentiates conversation starters and comments from each other, and adds quite cool <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technologyevangelist.com\/2008\/05\/brightkite_location.html\">location-aware<\/a> features on top of that. Suddenly I can follow conversations happening in the same neighborhood, or in the same city! But the problem is that they have made posting a little bit too cumbersome, and they make following and <a href=\"http:\/\/getsatisfaction.com\/brightkite\/topics\/_me_my_friends_view_could_list_also_comments_my_friends_make_other_notes\">finding conversations quite difficult<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nInstead of these services, Jaiku has been the place where the interesting stuff has been happening. But lately there has been too little development, and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/give_the_correct_status_code_when_you-re_down\/\">too much the failbird<\/a> happening for it to remain a viable platform. And so the Finnish web community has been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arcticstartup.com\/2008\/12\/15\/finland-finally-moving-to-twitter\/\">actively looking<\/a> for an alternative. I think <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qaiku.com\/\">Qaiku<\/a>, released today, could be it.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nSo, what is cool about Qaiku?\n<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Multilingual support:<\/strong> I can microblog in Finnish and English, and my international friends don't need to be bothered with a language they don't understand<\/li>\n<li><strong>Private channels:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/\">our company<\/a> can have a private channel where to handle <a href=\"http:\/\/webworkerdaily.com\/2007\/03\/03\/workstreaming-the-new-face-time\/\">actual workstreaming<\/a> without leaking confidential information<\/li>\n<li><strong>Favoriting and sharing:<\/strong> You can easily save interesting conversations to be accessed later, or share them in other services like <a href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/\">del.icio.us<\/a> or Facebook<\/li>\n<li><strong>An evolving platform:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/jaiku.com\/\">Jaiku<\/a> stagnated after <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaiku.com\/blog\/2007\/10\/09\/were-joining-google\/\">Google bought them<\/a>. With Qaiku there is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rohea.com\/\">a dynamic company<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_2-finally_legacy-free\/\">a cool platform<\/a> and many interesting ideas that will hopefully make the service evolve into interesting directions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Sidenote:<\/strong> if microblogs are all about conversations, why doesn't my blog provide a commenting feature? To quote <a href=\"http:\/\/al3x.net\/2009\/02\/24\/why-no-comments-more-everything-buckets.html\">Alex Payne<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe main reason I don\u2019t allow comments is that I want to inspire debate. I think people do their best writing when they\u2019re forced to defend their ideas on their own turf. It\u2019s one thing to leave a comment on someone else\u2019s blog, but quite another to put your argument in front of your own readers. It forces a level of consideration that, without fail, results in a higher quality exchange of ideas.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nWith the same idea, instead of the comments happening on my site, I hope you will either react via your own blog, or by communicating using a microblogging service.

Here's how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/8.09\/\">Midgard 8.09<\/a> copes:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n1. Our software comes with an installer program.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nYes. First you install Midgard using your distributions's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/installation-distros\/\">native package management tools<\/a>, and then let <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/datagard\/\">datagard<\/a> do the rest. It will install all necessary PEAR packages, create a database for you, tune cron and SOLR setup, and finally set up a working Midgard website.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n2. Installing or uninstalling our software does not require a reboot of your machine.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nYep. Apache needs to be restarted, though when you install Midgard or new <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/introduction_to_midgards_database_abstraction_system\/\">MgdSchemas<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n3. You can choose your locale and language at install time, and never have to see English again after that.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nLanguage isn't asked at install time. Instead, we use <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Content_negotiation\">browser content negotiation<\/a> to figure out the appropriate UI language.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n4. Eval versions of the latest edition(s) of our software are always available for download from the company website.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nMidgard is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/8.09\/licensing\/\">free software<\/a>, so you can always <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/download\/\">get the full version<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n5. Our WCM software comes with a fully templated \"sample web site\" and sample workflows, which work out-of-the-box.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nYes, there is a default template datagard will set your initial website with. We could do more to make the sample site \"do more\" out-of-the-box though.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n6. We ship a tutorial.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe stuff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/getting-started\/\">is<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/howto-midcom\/\">online<\/a>. There <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/discussion\/developer-forum\/solving_the_midgard_documentation_issues\/\">are plans<\/a> to start shipping it with Midgard, though.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n7. You can raise a support issue via a button, link, or menu command in our administrative interface.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nNope, but you can <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/newticket\">do it on our Trac<\/a> install. A good idea to add it to the UI, and so it <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/changeset\/21322\">will be there<\/a> in next release.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n8. All help files and documentation for the product are laid down as part of the install.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nCurrently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/\">documentation is online<\/a>, but more and more of it <a href=\"http:\/\/marcin.soltysiak.com\/6e8e234cc05d11ddbd788f585fd3eb96eb96\/\">is being included<\/a> to the install packages.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n9. We run our entire company website using the latest version of our own WCM products.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/uptime.netcraft.co.uk\/up\/graph?site=nemein.com\">Yes<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n10. Our salespeople understand how our products work.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nYep, seems so :-)\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n11. Our software does what we say it does.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nYes, though <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/1.8\/features\/\">the list from 1.8<\/a> would have new items in 8.09.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n12. We don't charge extra for our SDK.\n<br \/>13. Our licensing model is simple enough for a 5-year-old to understand.\n<br \/>14. We have one price sheet for all customers.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nFree software. Need I say more? <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/solution\/pricing\/\">Services pricing<\/a> is relatively straightforward too.\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n15. Our top executives are on Skype, Twitter, or some similar channel, and: Feel free to contact them directly at any time.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/people\/\">Yep<\/a>.

Exactly ten years ago we were sitting in a cramped office room in Espoo with <a href=\"http:\/\/jukkaz.wordpress.com\/\">Jukka Zitting<\/a>, frantically trying to put <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxtoday.com\/developer\/1999050701705NWSW\">a release<\/a> together. We had been <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_vikings_and_free_software\/\">building a web platform for our living history group<\/a>, and it had become useful for others too.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nWe both were Linux users, and back then the concept of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/\">Open Source<\/a> was becoming really popular. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/\">Mozilla<\/a> browser had been opened, and there were promising new projects like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/\">GNOME<\/a> out there. Therefore it felt natural that our tool, too, should be released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard\/8.09\/licensing\/\">as free software<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAnd so we did, with <a href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/19991005024620\/http:\/\/midgard.greywolves.org\/\">a simple web site<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxtoday.com\/developer\/1999050701705NWSW\">an announcement<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\nMidgard is freely-available platform for creating powerful web applications. It is fully based on Open Source software, giving you freedom to create your solutions in an open environment. Midgard is the tool for creating, modifying and maintaining dynamic database-enabled web services.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>Midgard already has a quite good set of features for creating powerful web sites, and is being used with successful results by some commercial and uncommercial organizations. But this is not where the development will end; rather, the development team also has more ambitious goals about revolutionizing the way people think about web development.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIndeed the development didn't end there. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/whoswho\/\">New people<\/a> started joining the project, there was a company that <a href=\"http:\/\/marc.info\/?l=midgard-user&amp;amp;m=96746976502481&amp;amp;w=2\">invested in it<\/a>, another company that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/2003-04-12-000\/\">contributed a component architecture<\/a>, and so on. Soon we had an active and dedicated community working on Midgard. And that is the way it has remained - a project run by multiple <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/community\/support-discussion\/consultancies\/\">companies<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/static\/f\/f32d7d68161711de9550fb63d46849ef49ef_midgardians-linkoping-20090321-small.jpg\">people<\/a>, supporting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midgard-and-multilingual-content\/\">multiple languages<\/a> and character sets. We even made the dream of having <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/maemo_and_midgard_go_well_together\/\">Midgard in our pockets<\/a> a reality.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-ee65cdc63b4c11debb93f31502ea6d626d62\/10thanniversary.jpg\" height=\"224\" width=\"400\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" alt=\"10th Anniversary of The Midgard Project\" title=\"10th Anniversary of The Midgard Project\" \/>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nI've been with the project the whole time, and it has given much. During these years I've traveled to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/sets\/72157608585090934\/\">Europe<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxgreenhouse.org\/about.html\">Asia<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/sets\/72157604038349521\/\">Africa<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/collections\/72157600946258420\/\">America<\/a> many times to tell about the project. I've presented our work in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/oscom-1\/\">several<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/oscom-2\/\">prestigious<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oscom.org\/events\/oscom-3\/\">universities<\/a>. It has put the <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/\">bread on my table<\/a>. And most importantly, I've <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/people\/Henri-Bergius\/722463139\">made friends<\/a> with people from all around the world.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nI don't think much of that would have happened if I had worked with proprietary software. The community, the friendships, and the opportunities are all something that makes the field of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsfe.org\/\">free software<\/a> unique.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nNow, ten years into the project it is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/10\/\">time to celebrate<\/a> the successes. And then dedicate ourselves efforts to the new generation of the project, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard2.org\/\">Midgard2<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard2_stable-generic_content_repository_for_web-desktop_and_mobile\/\">released just before<\/a> the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/10\/\">10th Anniversary<\/a>.

Modern computers and networks are drastically cheaper, but they're still hard to maintain. As networks have become faster, it is again easier to have someone else do the hard work. Computing has become more of a utility; users are more concerned with results than technical details, so the tech fades into the background.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>...\n<br \/>\n<br \/>There is one critical difference. When a computer is within your network, you can protect it with other security systems such as firewalls and IDSs. You can build a resilient system that works even if those vendors you have to trust may not be as trustworthy as you like. With any outsourcing model, whether it be cloud computing or something else, you can't. You have to trust your outsourcer completely. You not only have to trust the outsourcer's security, but its reliability, its availability, and its business continuity.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThis is something I've written about before.

It provides several advantages:\n<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Common rules for data access<\/strong> mean that multiple applications can work with same content without breaking consistency of the data<\/li>\n<li><strong>Signals about changes<\/strong> let applications know when another application using the repository modifies something, enabling collaborative data management between apps<\/li>\n<li><strong>Objects instead of SQL<\/strong> mean that developers can deal with data using APIs more compatible with the rest of their desktop programming environment, and without having to fear issues like <a href=\"http:\/\/xkcd.com\/327\/\">SQL injection<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Data model is scriptable<\/strong> when you use a content repository, meaning that users can easily write Python or PHP scripts to perform batch operations on their data without having to learn your storage format<\/li>\n<li><strong>Synchronization and sharing<\/strong> features can be implemented on the content repository level meaning that you gain these features without having to worry about them<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard2.org\/\">Midgard2<\/a> is a content repository library that is built on top of <em>glib<\/em>, <em>libgda<\/em> and <em>dbus<\/em>, making it fit the general free desktop infrastructure very well.

They\u2019ve diverged since then, and I\u2019d say Ubuntu\u2019s default Gnome desktop is in most ways better from a design and usability standpoint than Windows Vista. But it\u2019s still fundamentally a clone of Windows \u2014 menu bars within the window, minimize\/maximize\/close buttons at the top right of the window, the ugly single-character underlines in menu and button names. At a glance it looks like Windows with a different theme. The idea being that if you want Windows users to switch to Gnome or KDE, you\u2019ve got to make it feel familiar. But that\u2019s not how you get people to switch to a new product. People won\u2019t switch to something that\u2019s just a little bit better than what they\u2019re used to. People switch when they see something that is way better, holy shit better, wow, this is like ten times better.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>So I think Gnome and KDE are stuck with a problem similar to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uncanny_valley\">uncanny valley<\/a>. By establishing a conceptual framework that mimicks Windows, they can never really be that much different than Windows, and if they\u2019re not that much different, they can never be that much better. If you want to make something a lot better, you\u2019ve got to make something a lot different.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThis is a good point to consider as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.osnews.com\/story\/21242\/GNOME_3_0_To_Get_GNOME_Shell_Zeitgeist\">GNOME moves towards 3.0<\/a> with the promising <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gnome.org\/marina\/2009\/07\/05\/gcds-and-the-gnome-shell-sneak-peak\/\">GNOME shell<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/plasma.kde.org\/cms\/1029\">KDE's Plasma<\/a> has taken some steps also, but really, the examples we should look at here are <a href=\"http:\/\/moblin.org\/documentation\/moblin-netbook-intro\/how-get-around-moblin-netbook-ui\/myzone\">Moblin 2.0<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sugarlabs.org\/index.php?template=gallery&amp;page=gallery\">the Sugar desktop<\/a>.

More than just their underlying databases, they impose common rules for data access, and keep multiple applications up-to-date on data changes through signaling. Midgard2 provides a flexible content repository that avoids the restrictions of the traditional ORM approach. And not only your PHP web application, but also to possible Python, Objective-C and C# tools you use.\n<br \/>\n<br \/>This enables you to split applications into smaller, easily maintainable and scalable pieces that can be run on different systems and platforms as needed. In addition to web, the Midgard2 library can be used for desktop and mobile application development, building software that synchronizes with web services. It is based and engineered fully on the top of the desktop (GNOME) software stack. Being highly modular and having very little dependencies it scales from a note taking application to a full-blown CMS system.

Folks, the whole point of doing open-source code is to let it fork. The idea is to accelerate evolution by encouraging weird mutations. Creating an open source program and hoping it won't fork is like decorating your house with a zillion Christmas lights and a forty-foot inflatable Santa and hoping nobody stops to look at it.\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThis is an interesting way to look at Open Source. Traditionally <a href=\"http:\/\/fsfe.org\/about\/basics\/freesoftware.en.html\">freedom to fork<\/a> has been seen as a safeguard against dead projects or vendors, as <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/free_software_at_work-openpsa2_is_making_a_return\/\">a way to hand maintainership over<\/a> to parties that are still interested. \n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nBut what FSJ is talking about is forks being beneficial by themselves. This is the model that <a href=\"http:\/\/carsonified.com\/blog\/web-apps\/why-you-should-switch-from-subversion-to-git\/\">Distributed Version Control Systems like git<\/a> also promote: every developer has their own fork of the software, and <a href=\"http:\/\/whygitisbetterthanx.com\/#any-workflow\">merges to \"blessed\" repositories<\/a> happen under the watchful eye of a maintainer.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nThis is quite a different model than the traditional centralized way of working with projects. Merging between forks <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gnome.org\/bolsh\/2009\/09\/28\/estimating-merge-costs\/\">has its costs<\/a>, but if we embrace this model we gain lots of new developer flexibility and possible new workflows. DVCSs haven't been with us for a long time yet and so it takes some time for this new <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.pdark.de\/2009\/02\/05\/distributed-software-development-with-git\/\">distributed way of working<\/a> to take root.\n<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/microfeed_could_be_to_status_updates_what_telepathy_is_to_instant_messaging\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Microfeed could be to status updates what Telepathy is to instant messaging","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2009-10-26 09:12:23","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/microfeed.org\/\">Microfeed<\/a> is a new D-Bus service for handling <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Microblogging\">status updating and microblogging<\/a> entries from various services.

Put another way, the reason that people would buy the $69 Apple MagicMouse is because they want Apple\u2019s designers to just \u201cfigure it out\u201d for them, and provide them with an instantly-usable product. The reason why someone would pay $75 for this mouse is because it strictly keeps all the decision-making about what the mouse does in the hands (pun intended?) of the purchaser. <br \/><br \/> What I worry about, however, is that pockets of the open source community continue to largely be defined and driven by complexity, exclusivity, technocracy, and machismo. While I do support independence and freedom of choice in technology \u2014 and therefore open source \u2014 I prefer to do so <em>inclusively<\/em>, with an understanding that there are many more people who are not yet well served by technology because appropriate technology <em>has not been made more usable for them<\/em>.<\/blockquote>\n<p>More <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_innovation-and_how_choice_is_not_always_good\/\">focus on usability and clarity<\/a> would be needed with most Open Source projects, but there are already some bright spots. GNOME, for example, has good tradition in simple interfaces. I recently made the jump from Mac OS X to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canonical.com\/projects\/ubuntu\/unr\">Ubuntu Netbook Remix<\/a>, and have generally been quite happy with it.<\/p>\n<p>But for Open Source projects the challenge is more difficult than for proprietary products. On the other hand we want to provide a nice, usable experience, but we also want to let our users delve deeper into the functionality, to make changes and maybe even become contributors to the project. This is where new tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.laptop.org\/go\/OLPC_Human_Interface_Guidelines\/The_Laptop_Experience\/View_Source\">OLPC's View Source button<\/a> can do wonders if implemented more widely.<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/in_defence_of_urls_and_the_open_web\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"In defence of URLs and the Open Web","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2009-11-17 19:19:36","atom:content":"<p>An increasing number of web services and applications are emphasising search terms or pre-selected websites instead of allowing users to enter any address they choose.

In fact, the requirements that arise when managing web content have led to a class of content repository implementations that are comparable on a conceptual level. During the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iks-project.eu\/\">IKS<\/a> community <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iks-project.eu\/civicrm\/event\/info?reset=1&amp;id=3\">workshop in Rome<\/a> we got together to compare JCR (the <a href=\"http:\/\/jackrabbit.apache.org\/\">Jackrabbit<\/a> implementation) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>'s content repository. While in some cases the terminology might be different, many of the underlying ideas are identical. So we came up with a list of common traits and features of our content repositories. For comparison, there is also <a href=\"http:\/\/couchdb.apache.org\/\">Apache CouchDB<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, why use a Content Repository for your application instead of the old familiar RDBMS?

Have you ever sat back, scratched your chin, and wondered when the computer industry will break free of these current interfaces \u2014 which can be a hassle even for experts, and downright confusing (e.g. click vs. double-click) for the non-experts? Surely no one expects the computer interfaces of, say, 50 years hence to be based on these same metaphors and input methods. What\u2019s the next step?<\/blockquote>\n<p>A touchscreen tablet isn't really suited for <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/WIMP_%28computing%29\">the WIMP paradigm<\/a> as for example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/145609\/2010\/01\/tablet_text_entry.html\">text entry is quite difficult<\/a>, and you probably want larger, thumb-friendly user interface elements. This is where <a href=\"http:\/\/theappleblog.com\/2010\/01\/07\/microsofts-slate-exactly-unlike-apples-upcoming-tablet\/\">Microsoft's Tablet PC initiative failed<\/a>, trying to bring the regular WIMP user interface to the tablet.<\/p>\n<p>Instead what seems to be happening is that all the Wiis, iPhones, and N900s are now heading us towards a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Post-WIMP\">post-WIMP<\/a> world. Instead of indirect manipulation by mouse and keyboard we can now interact with our applications using the more natural ways of touching things on screen or moving the device around.<\/p>\n<p>This innovation will not be limited only to mobile APIs, web applications can already now know whether user is accessing them via a WIMP  system or a touchscreen device thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en\/css\/media_queries#-moz-touch-enabled\">CSS  media queries<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/dougt.org\/wordpress\/2009\/08\/orientation\/\">Javascript  orientation events<\/a> in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/firefox\/3.6\/releasenotes\/\">latest  Firefox<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The user interface innovation that is arriving thanks to these new interaction possibilities is quite promising, though it will probably take a while before we know what things actually work, and what are just fun demos.<\/p>\n<p>If you're thinking about new kinds of user interfaces, it might be a good time to read papers like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.useit.com\/papers\/noncommand.html\">Noncommand User Interfaces<\/a> (<em>Jakob Nielsen<\/em>, 1993) and <a href=\"http:\/\/worrydream.com\/MagicInk\/\">Magic Ink<\/a> (<em>Bret Victor<\/em>, 2006).<\/p>\n<p>I certainly am as we are in the process of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qaiku.com\/go\/5ebp\">defining a new kind of CMS UI<\/a> for <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/raise_the_hammer-midgard2_mjolnir_goes_live\/\">Midgard 2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> Gizmodo has a very nice <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/5452501\/the-apple-tablet-interface-must-be-like-this\">article on Jef Raskin's information appliance concept<\/a> and the evolution of GUIs.<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/ipad_and_information_appliances-a_free_software_angle\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"iPad and information appliances, a free software angle","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2010-01-28 09:51:43","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/apple\/news\/2010\/01\/apple-announces-ipad-attempts-to-change-the-world.ars\">Apple iPad<\/a> is certainly interesting.

And same thing with content - <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/amazon_kindle_could_be_the_library_of_the_working_nomad\/\">forget about  bookshelves<\/a> and stacks of CDs, instead simply dowloading all you need  from iTunes.<br \/><br \/> This sort of user experience obviously <a href=\"http:\/\/www.defectivebydesign.org\/ipad\">comes with a cost<\/a>. Important  computing concepts <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theiphoneblog.com\/2010\/01\/27\/ipad-multitasking-notifications-tv-subscriptions-camera-tethering-textbooks\/\">like multitasking are not supported<\/a>. The  iTunes\/App Store experience means that Apple <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/news\/2010\/01\/protestors-ipad-is-nothing-more-than-a-golden-calf-of-drm.ars\">is in the position to  ensure<\/a> no software or content competing with its or its business  partners' business model gets on the device. And most of the content you  buy for the device is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.defectivebydesign.org\/what_is_drm\">DRM'd<\/a>, meaning that you're only renting it for  the time allowed by content owners, never buying.<br \/><br \/> Even with the limitations concerned I can see myself buying an iPad. It  would serve as a very nice device for web surfing from the couch and as  an e-reader on business trips. I can also see myself <a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwriteweb.com\/start\/2010\/01\/what-the-ipad-means-for-startu.php\">running demos<\/a> and  presentations from it instead of a laptop.<br \/><br \/> Even with the limitations concerned, it is likely that the iPad will  happen, and will blaze the trail towards a new way of personal  computing. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stephenfry.com\/2010\/01\/28\/ipad-about\/\">Stephen Fry says it well<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Like the first iPhone, iPad 1.0 is a John the Baptist preparing the way  of what is to come, but also like iPhone 1.0 (and Jokanaan himself too  come to that) iPad 1.0 is still fantastic enough in its own right to be  classed as a stunningly exciting object, one that you will want NOW and  one that will not be matched this year by any company. In the future,  when it has two cameras for fully featured video conferencing, GPS and  who knows what else built in (1080 HD TV reception and recording and  nano projection, for example) and when the iBook store has recorded its  100 millionth download and the thousands of accessories and peripherals  that have invented uses for iPad that we simply can\u2019t now imagine \u2013 when  that has happened it will all have seemed so natural and inevitable  that today\u2019s nay-sayers and sceptics will have forgotten that they ever doubted its potential.<\/blockquote>\n<p>The success of iPad will mean more than just a completely new level of App  Store economy. Other companies will certainly seek to emulate the model,  coming up with their own <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Post-WIMP\">post-WIMP<\/a> devices and their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2009\/05\/26\/nokia-ovi-store-now-live-everywhere\/\">own content and  software ecosystems<\/a>. This all will be a challenge for the free software  movement.<br \/><br \/> The world of free software is still very much stuck in what computing  was in the 90s. We think of desktop computers, we <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/free_desktop_and_the_cloud\/\">do not integrate with  the web<\/a>. And we do not get the transformation that is happening with  personal computers. Taught by smartphones and cloud applications, users  are moving from desktops through simple netbooks towards <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/5452501\/the-apple-tablet-interface-must-be-like-this\">information  appliances<\/a>.<br \/><br \/> With information appliances you need <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/direct_manipulation_interfaces\/\">a seamless user interface<\/a>. You need  an ecosystem where content comes alongside the software to utilize it.  You need to move past the old WIMP metaphors and the idea of separation  between data stored in a a file system and the software manipulating it.<br \/><br \/> So far the first convincing attempt towards this direction I've seen in  the free software world is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialdesktop.org\/\">KDE's Social Desktop initiative<\/a>. It allows  users to connect with each other straight through the desktop, and it  allows discovery of new applications and content to download and use  straight in the applications. We also use it with <a href=\"http:\/\/danielwilms.wordpress.com\/2010\/01\/27\/download-assistant-for-extras-applications\/\">Maemo's new App  Downloader<\/a>.<br \/><br \/> Threatened by the cloud from one end, and closed-ecosystem appliances  from the other, it will be interesting to see how we react. Will we rise  to the challenge and start providing new user experiences? Will we  build a free cloud? Will we integrate with initiatives like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/wiki\/Main_Page\">Project  Gutenberg<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/\">Creative Commons<\/a> to provide the content integration?

In this case we're doing a simple \"attendee\" object that amends Midgard's built-in person record with information related to the conference:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;Schema xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/repligard\/1.4\"&gt;\n    &lt;type name=\"openbossa_attendee\" table=\"openbossa_attendee\"&gt;\n        &lt;property name=\"id\" type=\"unsigned integer\" primaryfield=\"id\"&gt;\n            &lt;description&gt;Local non-replication-safe database identifier&lt;\/description&gt;\n        &lt;\/property&gt;\n        &lt;property name=\"person\" type=\"unsigned integer\" link=\"midgard_person:id\"&gt;\n            &lt;description&gt;Person attending the event&lt;\/description&gt;\n        &lt;\/property&gt;\n        &lt;property name=\"registration\" type=\"datetime\"&gt;\n            &lt;description&gt;Registration date of the attendee&lt;\/description&gt;\n        &lt;\/property&gt;\n        &lt;property name=\"likesbeer\" type=\"boolean\"&gt;\n            &lt;description&gt;Whether the attendee likes beer&lt;\/description&gt;\n        &lt;\/property&gt;\n    &lt;\/type&gt;\n&lt;\/Schema&gt;\n<\/pre>\n<p>Then we just save this XML file into <code>\/usr\/share\/midgard2\/schema\/<\/code> so that Midgard will find it.<\/p>\n<h2>Initiating the repository connection<\/h2>\n<p>Once the MgdSchema is in place it is time to <a href=\"http:\/\/xkcd.com\/353\/\">import antigravity<\/a> and start hacking in Python.  The code works pretty much in the same way in other languages Midgard is available for, but Python is used here for the sake of simplicity. First we load the Midgard extension:<\/p>\n<pre>import _midgard as midgard\n<\/pre>\n<p>Then we setup the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midgard\/core\/9.9\/midgard-connection.html\">repository connection<\/a>. With these <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midgard\/core\/9.9\/midgard-config.html\">settings<\/a> we will store our content into an SQLite database located in  <code>~\/.midgard2\/data\/midgardexample.db<\/code>:<\/p>\n<pre>configuration = midgard.config()\nconfiguration.dbtype = 'SQLite'\nconfiguration.database = 'midgardexample'\n\n# Open a Midgard repository connection with our config\nconnection = midgard.connection()\nconnection.open_config(configuration)\n<\/pre>\n<p>As this is the first time we're interacting with the repository we need to tell Midgard to  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midgard\/core\/9.9\/midgard-storage.html\">prepare the storage<\/a> for itself and also for our new <code>openbossa_attendee<\/code> class:<\/p>\n<pre>midgard.storage.create_base_storage()\nmidgard.storage.create_class_storage('midgard_person')\nmidgard.storage.create_class_storage('midgard_parameter')\nmidgard.storage.create_class_storage('openbossa_attendee')\n<\/pre>\n<h2>Interacting with data<\/h2>\n<p>First we create a person <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midgard\/core\/9.9\/midgard-object.html\">object<\/a> with our attendee:<\/p>\n<pre>person = midgard.mgdschema.midgard_person()\nperson.firstname = 'Leif'\nperson.lastname = 'Eriksson'\nperson.create()\n<\/pre>\n<p>Then we create our attendee object and link that with the person we just created:<\/p>\n<pre>attendee = midgard.mgdschema.openbossa_attendee()\nattendee.person = person.id\nattendee.likesbeer = True\nattendee.create()\n<\/pre>\n<h2>Querying data<\/h2>\n<p>Later we'll want to find out about all Leifs attending the event. We do this by using the  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/api-docs\/midgard\/core\/9.9\/midgard-query-builder.html\">Midgard query builder<\/a>:<\/p>\n<pre>qb = midgard.query_builder('openbossa_attendee')\nqb.add_constraint('person.firstname', '=', 'Leif')\nattendees = qb.execute()\n<\/pre>\n<p>The query builder returns us a list of matching attendee objects. We can go through them and also fetch the associated persons:<\/p>\n<pre>for attendee in attendees:\n    person = midgard.mgdschema.midgard_person()\n    person.get_by_id(attendee.person)\n    if attendee.likesbeer:\n        print \"%s, %s is attending the event\" % (person.lastname, person.firstname)\n<\/pre>\n<p>Then we can update the persons with their email addresses:<\/p>\n<pre>    person.email = 'leif@vinland.no'\n    person.update()\n<\/pre>\n<p>For basic data handling, that's it! When you need more, you can extend objects with  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php_midgard_object_attachments\/\">file attachments<\/a> or  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/php_midgard_object_parameters\/\">parameters<\/a>.

For the implications of this development -- most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm -- are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually \"surging\" large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points.

The event was held in a spa resort off in the countryside near Brussels. A place where the developers were comfortably separated from the busy towns by forests and country roads.<\/p>\n<p>I went to the UDS with two goals in my mind: to discuss <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/making_the_gnome_desktop_location-aware\/\">making the Ubuntu desktop location-aware<\/a>, and to figure out what sort of role <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard2.org\/\">Midgard<\/a>, our content repository could play in the Ubuntu space. Normally such things would be better approached by talking to upstream projects and distributions, but as Ubuntu is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.0d.be\/2010\/05\/13\/gnome-and-operating-systems\/\">taking an increasingly active role<\/a> in developing itself to be a <em>comprehensive and unique operating system<\/em>, it would be a better place to accomplish such wide-ranging changes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Location-awareness<\/strong> was a area that many were interested in. Ubuntu already had considered <a href=\"http:\/\/geoclue.freedesktop.org\/\"><strong>GeoClue<\/strong><\/a>, our location service, to be a component of the distribution in Lucid Lynx, but that <a href=\"https:\/\/blueprints.launchpad.net\/ubuntu\/+spec\/desktop-lucid-gnome-geoclue\">plan had been abandoned<\/a> due to the low-maintained status of the software. However, now that GeoClue has become the <a href=\"http:\/\/jaaksi.blogspot.com\/2010\/04\/meego-is-now-opened.html\">geolocation framework for MeeGo<\/a> things are about to change, and so there is <a href=\"https:\/\/blueprints.launchpad.net\/ubuntu\/+spec\/desktop-maverick-geoclue\/\">a significant possibility<\/a> to get GeoClue into Ubuntu as well.<\/p>\n<p>GeoClue by itself will obviously not do much, and so making applications use it is the important thing. Some applications already support location information and could be changed to include those features by default. This includes <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.pierlux.com\/2009\/06\/15\/geolocation-in-empathy-now-real\/en\/\"><strong>Empathy<\/strong><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.pierlux.com\/2009\/06\/15\/geolocation-in-empathy-now-real\/en\/\"> sharing location<\/a> information with instant messaging buddies, and <strong>Getting Things GNOME<\/strong> TODO manager being able to <a href=\"http:\/\/live.gnome.org\/gtg\/soc\/geolocalized_tasks\">tag action items with location<\/a>. <strong>Zeitgeist<\/strong> is intending to start tagging and searching activity <a href=\"https:\/\/code.launchpad.net\/~mortenmjelva\/zeitgeist\/geoclue-extension\">history with location<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/patchpanel.blogspot.com\/2010\/05\/ubuntu-1004-my-two-cents.html\"><strong>Gwibber<\/strong><\/a> also wants to include location sharing to interface with social web services like Brightkite, Qaiku and Google Latitude. Another reasonably low-hanging fruit would be to make the <strong>Ubuntu panel clock<\/strong> automatically change time zones as you travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Midgard in Ubuntu<\/strong> is a bit trickier question. A lot of Ubuntu has now been developed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2R1qf5_6Zt4\">utilize the <strong>CouchDB<\/strong> document database<\/a>, which provides quite <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/what_is_a_content_repository\/\">similar storage services as Midgard<\/a> does. <a href=\"http:\/\/couchdb.apache.org\/\">CouchDB's<\/a> cool map\/reduce algorithms and replication capabilities have enabled Ubuntu developers to <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/open-source\/reviews\/2009\/11\/good-karma-ars-reviews-ubuntu-910.ars\/6\">quickly integrate a content repository<\/a> into many applications and to provide a cloud storage and synchronization service to users of the operating system.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/open-source\/reviews\/2010\/05\/lucid-dream-ars-reviews-ubuntu-1004.ars\/9\">CouchDB introduces some problems<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>CouchDB can't seem to handle the load of Gwibber's messages, leading to excessive CPU consumption and poor performance in certain cases. For example, the overhead of computing the views causes lag when the user switches streams after Gwibber refreshes. The cost of pulling the account configuration data out of the database can also sometimes cause a noticeable lag that lasts up to four or five seconds when opening Gwibber's account manager.<\/blockquote>\n<p>CouchDB has been designed with web servers in mind, and in many situations having a constantly-running Erlang process and having to do HTTP roundtrips to access data are undesirable on more constrained computers. We <a href=\"http:\/\/protoblogr.net\/blog\/view\/finally_got_them_working.html\">ported CouchDB to Maemo<\/a> a few years ago and the performance was terrible. I'd imagine the same issues on netbooks and other small hardware that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.markshuttleworth.com\/archives\/383\">Ubuntu's Light initiative<\/a> targets.<\/p>\n<p>On such environments <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sil\/status\/13782972356\">Midgard might be a better option<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/ratatoskr_is_out-midgard2_content_repository_goes_lts\/\">Midgard's recent LTS release<\/a> uses regular <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome-db.org\/News\">relational databases<\/a> for fast performance and low footprint, utilizes important pieces of free desktop architecture like D-Bus signalling and <a href=\"http:\/\/live.gnome.org\/GObjectIntrospection\">GObject Introspection<\/a>, and has been proven to work well even on low-end devices like the Nokia N900. And yet it provides <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application\/\">full content repository APIs<\/a> comparable to CouchDB, and can even handle <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/couchdb_and_midgard_talking_with_each_other\/\">replication with Couch<\/a>. One way to make Midgard possible, then, would be to provide Python <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Specifications\/desktopcouch\">DesktopCouch APIs<\/a> to it.<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting technology discussed much in UDS was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.puppetlabs.com\/\"><strong>Puppet<\/strong><\/a>, the \u00a0systems administration tool. It enables developers to describe their setups in a <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.puppetlabs.com\/guides\/language_tutorial.html\">object-oriented declarative language<\/a>, and then just let Puppet to <em>make it so<\/em>. I attended two Puppet sessions, and picked up a Kindle edition of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pulling-Strings-Puppet-Configuration-Management\/dp\/1590599780\">the Puppet book<\/a> which I read on the train ride <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qaiku.com\/channels\/show\/maemork\/view\/00ddfcd65e1411dfacfeebea881863c763c7\/\">to the Netherlands<\/a>. As my company manages lots of Midgard web servers for our customers, automating system setup and maintenance on top of Puppet and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/nemein_is_going_to_ubuntu_server\/\">Ubuntu Server<\/a> might save us lots of time and effort.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, quite an enlightening <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qaiku.com\/channels\/show\/ubuntu\/view\/adaba27e5c2f11dfb0df111cdab35b375b37\/\">two days in the event<\/a>.

Free Software? What we need is Open Projects","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2010-06-14 17:32:42","atom:content":"<p>Both companies and public administration are starting to understand the benefits of free software: reducing vendor lock-in, possibility to continue development of a project after a vendor has gone out of business or lost interest, and in general enjoying <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsfe.org\/about\/basics\/freesoftware.en.html\">the four freedoms<\/a>. But unfortunately much of this understanding has been limited to the context of licenses.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, licenses are only a small part of a project being truly open. They are just a layer of insurance comparable to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Source_code_escrow\">traditional source code escrow<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What we really need is understanding of a bit more wholesome project openness. The actual goals of openness that the license should derive from. Here are some aspects to consider:<\/p>\n<h2>Project transparency<\/h2>\n<p>If a project aims to have outside users or contributors, they need to be able to see the history of changes in the software, decisions that have been made, and the open list of bugs or enhancements being worked on.<\/p>\n<p>A released software package answers these questions poorly regardless of a license. Instead, what is needed is the project being developed out in the open, preferably using one of the common project hosting environments like <a href=\"http:\/\/gitorious.org\/\">Gitorious<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/\">GitHub<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/\">SourceForge<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/launchpad.net\/\">Launchpad<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/savannah.gnu.org\/\">GNU Savannah<\/a>. You can also host the project yourself using something like <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.edgewall.org\/\">Trac<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/gforge.org\/gf\/\">GForge<\/a> but this limits access and visibility to the project.<\/p>\n<p>The project must actually use the service, not just by code dumps at release time, but with constant development activity visible as code commits and active issue tracking. Depending on business goals it is also good to have future plans for the project visible to the public.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is mandatory for others to gauge the viability of a software package to their needs. Josh Berkus presented a good <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qaiku.com\/channels\/show\/linux\/view\/d3fb5f6247e111df930ef7d85b52fc0ffc0f\/#qaiku_62cee0f4482011df962869ae38aee37fe37f\">list of things you shouldn't do<\/a> to create a community around your project.<\/p>\n<h2>Contribution policy<\/h2>\n<p>Potential users and developers need to know how they can make their changes available to a package. Is it possible at all, are <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gnome.org\/bolsh\/2009\/04\/08\/copyright-assignment-and-other-barriers-to-entry\/\">copyright assignments or some contributor agreements<\/a> necessary, is there a documented process for submitting changes or even becoming an acknowledged developer in the project? Or is the project being developed behind closed curtains of a company?<\/p>\n<h2>Requirements and software stack<\/h2>\n<p>Another area some projects fail at is communicating how the software can be built and installed. If the only practical way to run the software is from released binary packages, or through buying consulting, is it truly open? Does the project require additional closed software or specific hardware to run with?<\/p>\n<h2>Specialized licensing concerns<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on the type of software other concerns may be being able to provide it as part of a Software as a Service offering, or being able to deploy it on some constrained or closed hardware.<\/p>\n<p>Some software licenses address these questions clearly, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.osor.eu\/communities\/eupl\/blog\/eupl-or-gplv3\">EUPL<\/a> requiring contributions to be opened also when the software is offered in SaaS manner, or GPLv3 forbidding device manufacturers from locking down or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tivoization\">'Tivoizing' their hardware products<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping up<\/h2>\n<p>Most of these questions are well understood within the free software community itself. But we generally communicate it poorly by focusing the discussion on license technicalities. I guess this is because we're so used to working in this open manner that we take the it as a given. But users, especially in the public administration only see the licensing side of things because that is the only aspect we talk about and have definitions for.<\/p>\n<p>A good exception for this is the Apache Software Foundation that has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apache.org\/foundation\/how-it-works.html#management\">well-defined set of rules<\/a> that <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/guides\/proposal.html#template-current-status\">projects must follow<\/a> before they can be adopted under the ASF umbrella.

Since the server itself is written in PHP you don't have any additional dependencies besides <em>php-cli<\/em>.

With Windows 7, Microsoft's dominant OS is no longer the big, obvious heavy it once was, at least from the software design standpoint.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, web browser is the tool I spend most of my time in. While I still hack using desktop-based development tools instead of <a href=\"https:\/\/mozillalabs.com\/skywriter\/\">the cloud<\/a>, almost everything else I need is already happening on the web.<\/p>\n<p>This means <em>the operating system doesn't really matter<\/em>. Linux, Mac, Windows, KDE, MeeGo, GNOME, whatever is the best at managing my browser windows and web apps may be the winner, and the only desktop <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/free_desktop_and_the_cloud\/\">app that matters<\/a> is the browser. Or actually, not the browser but the things you access with it.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of looking back and competing on the merits of what desktops were back in the 90s, how about really focusing on the desktops of the future? You need mobility, support for touch interfaces, and especially, you need great support for managing different web applications. Their shortcuts, their preferred screen size, their cookies and their local storage.<\/p>\n<p>Firefox is already working on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.azarask.in\/blog\/post\/designing-tab-candy\/\">how to manage web apps better<\/a>, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.windowsvalley.com\/pin-websites-to-taskbar-and-start-menu-with-internet-explorer-9\/\">is IE9<\/a>. But how about trying to outdo them on the desktop level? Maybe desktop could manage privacy, access to user information, and context probably better than a browser can? Handling native applications and web applications in the same way might be another good idea, including making them supported in <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.ubuntu.com\/MessagingMenu\">notification systems<\/a> etc.<\/p>\n<p>Qt, GTK+, Clutter and QML may be great toolkits for some situations, but we should accept that HTML is another toolkit, and really the only cross-platform one out there, and that it should coexist seamlessly with the native toolkits. Fedora's <a href=\"http:\/\/lwn.net\/Articles\/408052\/\">Mike McGrath might be on to something<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong>, responding to <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gnome.org\/johannes\/2010\/10\/11\/the-browser-myth\/\">The browser myth comment<\/a> by Johannes Schmid:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Most people will probably answer that the web browser is the application they use most often. That might be true, but is it the application they spent their time with when they are working? I certainly hope not!<\/blockquote>\n<p>It wasn't my intention to claim everything happens through browser, but instead to suggest that web applications should be treated as equals to regular desktop applications, with similar services and management UIs provided for both.<\/p>\n<p>The split between web applications and desktop application most likely varies between companies. In our company most of the business collaboration tools are web-based, as is the primary access to email, calendaring, contact information, financials, etc. We use in-browser office tools and OpenOffice.org with probably a 50\/50 split (I've found OOo can make a lot prettier presentations than the current web-based offerings for instance). And even software development happens more in the browser, except for the people involved with the CMS back-end.<\/p>\n<p>This didn't use to be the case a few years ago. The web evolves a lot more quickly than the traditional desktop world, and so when looking for better tools we increasingly end up selecting a web-based one. I'm sure this is a process that happens in companies everywhere, though more slowly with conservative big enterprises. Making the free desktop the best environment to use web applications in would hugely increase the platform's appeal.<\/p>\n<p>Another great opportunity with web applications is their portability. We will probably never get the whole world to switch to GNOME or KDE, but if our free software is available through a browser they can still benefit and participate in our efforts. Using web tools also exposes the free software community to the large group of developers who have bypassed the traditional desktop model and grown up making web apps.<\/p>\n<p>Using HTML as a toolkit may not necessarily mean interacting with  regular web servers. Many regular desktop applications embed WebKit or  some other HTML widget to display rich content. It is also quite  possible to run full web systems on your own computer, made even easier  with tools like the <a href=\"..\/..\/midgard_runtime_brings_our_web_framework_to_the_desktop\/\">Midgard Runtime<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/couchapp.org\/page\/index\">CouchApps<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update<\/strong>, responding to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kdedevelopers.org\/node\/4337\">Can Web Developers Scale?<\/a> by Jaroslaw Staniek:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Can Web Developers Scale?\n<blockquote>\"That's like saying that there's a huge pool of high-school physics teacher who can now contribute to solving cold fusion.

But how about <em>real work<\/em>? <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.seattlepi.com\/microsoft\/archives\/208708.asp\">Let me quote<\/a> again:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"I think PCs are going to be like trucks,\" <a href=\"http:\/\/d8.allthingsd.com\/20100601\/steve-jobs-session\/\">[Steve] Jobs said at D8<\/a>, the All Things Digital tech show. \"Less people will need them.

I use my Maemo phone or a tablet for most of reading and fun stuff, leaving the computer mainly for development and other project work. In such work you often need multiple windows open, and often jump from one task to another. How to maintain focus?<\/p>\n<p>For me, the best solution was to use a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tiling_window_manager\">tiling window manager<\/a>. With a tiling window manager you get rid of overlapping windows, and the system instead fits everything you have running to a single screen. Here's how my hacking environment looks like:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1dfe5d78d0bba5ee5d711df9f75c7d1c8d6e5a0e5a0_xmonad-midgardmvc-small.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"xmonad-midgardmvc-small.png\" title=\"xmonad-midgardmvc-small.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this situation I've split my working environment to multiple per-context workspaces. One includes browser and email. Another has instant messaging. And the third is the actual work, running <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chromium.org\/Home\">a browser<\/a> for testing stuff, a <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/indeyets\/appserver-in-php\/wiki\">PHP AppServer<\/a> console, and another console for actual code editing. On top of all this I have the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gnome.org\/\">GNOME<\/a> panel, and the whole setup is managed using the excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/xmonad.org\/\">xmonad<\/a> tiling window manager.<\/p>\n<p>Some desktop environments, like the <a href=\"http:\/\/meego.com\/devices\/netbook\">MeeGo netbook<\/a> are built right from the beginning with such focus-improving ideas in mind, but I felt that a \"real desktop environment\" with tiling might fit my needs better.<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/me_on_meego\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Me on MeeGo","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2010-11-08 11:07:51","atom:content":"<p>This is me normally:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1dfeb2849258e72eb2811df9418cff85d556eea6eea_bergie_haydarpasa2_100x100.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"bergie_haydarpasa2_100x100.png\" title=\"bergie_haydarpasa2_100x100.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is me on MeeGo:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1dfeb285a49033ceb2811dfa01fef8418608bb28bb2_bergie_meego_100x100.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"bergie_meego_100x100.png\" title=\"bergie_meego_100x100.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Thanks, <a href=\"http:\/\/tabulacrypticum.wordpress.com\/\">Texrat<\/a>!<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/help_testing_the_openpsa_business_suite\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Help testing the OpenPSA business suite","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2010-11-08 14:56:57","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/openpsa2.org\/about\/\">OpenPSA<\/a> is an web-based management suite for consulting companies.

For many of us this was the first time we're actually using MeeGo on a device, and so I thought to post some notes on how it feels.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1dff40fe734a180f40f11dfa23999078cd0a757a757_ideapad-meego-conference.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"ideapad-meego-conference.png\" title=\"ideapad-meego-conference.png\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>IdeaPad hardware<\/h2>\n<p>The IdeaPad looks and feels like a typical netbook: cheap plastic construction, big protruding battery, small trackpad and screen. However, it suddenly becomes quite interesting when you swivel the screen around, making it a tablet computer with a nicely sized touchscreen.<\/p>\n<p>The whole package is quite much heavier than my current <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/5102759273\/\">MacBook Air<\/a>, but that is a price you pay for almost eight hour battery life. I wish a PC manufacturer started making as clean hardware as Apple does. A <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nokia_Booklet_3G\">Nokia Booklet<\/a> with MeeGo would come close.<\/p>\n<p>All the normal stuff like WiFi (mine had Atheros), display-out and touchscreen work. For some reason trackpad buttons don't, and there is a mystery SIM card slot under the battery that needs a bit more investigation. Integrated 3G would be sweet!<\/p>\n<h2>MeeGo Netbook<\/h2>\n<p>When we got the netbooks in the conference there were two options for the install: fully free software, or one with proprietary WiFi drivers. Both images were development snapshots of <a href=\"http:\/\/meego.com\/devices\/netbook\">MeeGo Netbook 1.1<\/a>, a descendant of Intel's<a href=\"http:\/\/www.raiden.net\/articles\/review_moblin_21\/\"> Moblin desktop<\/a>. The system boots very quickly, and generally feels very responsive, though at times the bundled Chromium browser can make the whole system slow.<\/p>\n<p>Getting the netbook set up was reasonably straightforward. Different areas of the MeeGo toolbar had integrated functionality for various services, with setup wizards for connecting to your accounts on them. In minutes I had my work calendar on the system, was connected to the IM networks I use, and had tweets appearing on the <a href=\"http:\/\/meego.com\/devices\/netbook\/netbook-screenshots\">\"MyZone\" desktop<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Having all this cloud integration in place means the IdeaPad can quite easily serve in its intended \"conference laptop\" purpose - I don't need to do anything special to copy my data to the device, just connect it to various services.<\/p>\n<h2>IdeaPad as a tablet<\/h2>\n<p>Out of the box MeeGo Netbook doesn't deal with the tablet mode of the IdeaPad too well. Touchscreen works but generally applications are clumsy to use with it, and there is no on-screen keyboard. This can be fixed by installing a <a href=\"http:\/\/liliputing.com\/2010\/05\/chrometouch-makes-the-google-chrome-web-browser-tablet-friendly.html\">Chrome kinetic scrolling extension<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.neteril.org\/2010\/11\/19\/turning-your-meego-lenovo-s10-3t-into-a-real-slate\/\">grabbing the on-screen keyboard<\/a> from the MeeGo Handheld repositories.<\/p>\n<p>I've also heard reports that the IdeaPad would be able to run the full Handheld UX. But probably it is better to wait and see what kind of touch elements appear once the hackers who got their netbooks in the conference have time to play with them more. The MeeGo Forum has a <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.meego.com\/showthread.php?t=1995\">thread discussing IdeaPad improvements<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Just how MeeGo is this?<\/h2>\n<p>The Netbook user interface comes from the Moblin project, and so builds on top of the GNOME stack, and ships mostly with applications coming from that desktop, even though MeeGo's <a href=\"http:\/\/meego.com\/developers\/meego-architecture\/meego-architecture-layer-view\">official architecture<\/a> designates Qt as the <a href=\"http:\/\/meego.com\/developers\/meego-architecture\/meego-architecture-api-view\">toolkit to use<\/a>. It may be that at some point the Netbook user interface will get rewritten, but the more important thing to developers is that apart from default applications the MeeGo Netbook appears to be a pure MeeGo system: it uses MeeGo repositories, and all the <a href=\"http:\/\/meego.com\/developers\/meego-architecture\/meego-architecture-domain-view\">services like<\/a> Telepathy, GeoClue and Tracker are there.<\/p>\n<p>This means that you can easily start developing and experimenting with MeeGo application development on this machine. The <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.meego.com\/Community_Application_Support\">Community Applications system<\/a>, including PPAs on the <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.meego.com\/Build_Infrastructure\/Community_Builder\">community OBS<\/a> are being set up to help this, and there was some discussion on how to run <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qt_Creator\">Qt Creator<\/a> on it. For now Git, Gedit and Python are enough for me.<\/p>\n<h2>Computer minimalism<\/h2>\n<p>I've <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/unitasking_and_the_desktop\/\">written earlier about unitasking<\/a> and the importance of having a computer environment that helps maintaining focus and getting things done. In this particular branch of <a href=\"http:\/\/brooksreview.net\/2010\/11\/best-solutions\/\">computer minimalism<\/a> the idea is that generally you should be doing just one thing at a time, with minimal distraction.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/help.meego.com\/netbook\/zones\/switch-zones-or-screens\">MeeGo Zones<\/a> paradigm does this reasonably well. In a normal usage situation there is nothing else on the screen than the application you're working on. The applications themselves can be organized between multiple zones, so you can cluster things based on working context.<\/p>\n<p>MeeGo's toolbar autohides to the top and can be invoked by either moving the mouse there, or by pressing the Windows key. There you can quickly access areas of current information, like calendar events, TODOs, instant messages and tweets. When you've done handling those just let the toolbar slide away and you're back in your application. Information access, with minimal hassle.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping up<\/h2>\n<p>This initial look at MeeGo makes me a bit torn. On the other hand, I love the minimalistic interface paradigm, and the UI feels fast and smooth, but also lots of necessary software is missing and many parts feel unpolished. But still this isn't bad for a new OS that has been around for only about eight months. The hardware itself isn't too great, but probably the best current option for a cheap tablet\/netbook convertible.<\/p>\n<p>For now I plan to keep MeeGo Netbook on the machine. It won't be my work computer, but instead a travel and conference machine for quick hacking and browsing while on the road. I'll keep monitoring <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.meego.com\/showthread.php?t=1995\">the relevant conversations<\/a> to see how things improve, and will also try to write some improvements myself. The first step, though, is to report the bunch of <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.meego.com\/showpost.php?p=13221&amp;postcount=26\">bugs we've found<\/a> so far.<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/php-finally_getting_an_ecosystem\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"PHP: Finally getting an ecosystem?","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2010-11-23 17:55:18","atom:content":"<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1dff72a17ecddcaf72a11df85f553d3de64e756e756_elephphant.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"PHP\" title=\"PHP\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;\" \/>One of my main concerns with PHP has been the lack of ecosystem. Almost all libraries and tools are written with a specific framework in mind, creating separate ecosystems around <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/modules\">Drupal<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/framework.zend.com\/apidoc\/1.11\/\">Zend Framework<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/trac.midgard-project.org\/browser\/branches\/ragnaroek\/midcom\">Midgard<\/a> and others instead of an ecosystem benefiting all users of the language.<\/p>\n<p>There have been efforts at this, like PEAR before, but they have mostly stagnated. This is why I was really happy to see <a href=\"http:\/\/schlitt.info\/opensource\/blog\/0737_apache_zeta_components_was_ez_components.html\">a post<\/a> today on Planet PHP about the former <a href=\"http:\/\/ezcomponents.org\/\">eZ Components<\/a> library entering Apache incubation as <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/zetacomponents\/\">Zeta Components<\/a>. While <em>components<\/em> in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/documentation\/midcom\/\">Midgard terminology<\/a> mean full applications that can be plugged into your website (like <em>modules<\/em> in other ecosystems like Drupal), in case of Zeta Components the term means general purpose libraries:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Apache Zeta Components are a high quality, general purpose library of loosly coupled components for development of applications based on PHP 5. Beside typical modules for web application development, like a Template engine, Database tools and an MVC component, Apache Zeta Components contain command line tools, a chart rendering library, a WebDAV server, a universal document conversion component and many more tools to ease developers live.<\/blockquote>\n<p>This should be great news to anybody working with PHP. The current list of Zeta Components appears to provide a quite comprehensive <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/zetacomponents\/documentation\/trunk.html\">list of useful libraries<\/a>, through Apache the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apache_License\">licensing is very permissive<\/a>, and as <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/open_source-free_software-what_we_need_is_open_projects\/\">I've written before<\/a>, Apache has a great set of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apache.org\/foundation\/how-it-works.html#management\">guidelines<\/a> its projects must follow.<\/p>\n<p>Zeta Components is certainly a project that I will be watching. And hopefully it can be a place where we can start contributing some of the generic PHP libraries and tools from the Midgard project. A first target that comes to mind is the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/midgardmvc_helper_location\">generic geolocation library<\/a> that we have.<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/coss_and_meego_meet_in_helsinki_on_dec_1st\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"COSS and MeeGo meet in Helsinki on Dec 1st","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2010-11-25 17:22:37","atom:content":"<p>Next Wednesday will have the annual <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coss.fi\/en\">Finnish Centre for Open Source Solutions<\/a> member meeting and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Helsinki-MeeGo-Network\/\">Helsinki MeeGo Network<\/a> meetup held together in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scandichotels.com\/en\/Hotels\/Countries\/Finland\/Helsinki\/Hotels\/Scandic-Continental-Helsinki\/\">Hotel Scandic Continental<\/a>.

The amateur computer programmer Linus Torvalds had come up with a way of enabling an unlimited number of people to work on the development of the same program source code. This was to prove to be a highly successful approach. Linux, which since then has evolved into a huge success, is one of the most significant open-source operating systems. The Internet would not be possible without a service infrastructure, which is currently largely based on Linux and open source. <br \/><br \/> Torvalds understood that a complex system, such as a global network, can only function if there are a large number of motivated individuals contributing to its development. This is expressed in another famous statement made by Torvalds: \"Given enough eyeballs, any bugs are shallow\". In other words, the difficulty of problems depends on the number of people involved in finding a solution.<br \/><br \/>Linux, which was created by Torvalds, and other open source systems combine the foremost virtues of Finnish functionality: nurturing the commons in a successful way, and the shrewd use of human resources. Thus it is probably no coincidence that the main impetus for open source came from Finland, from a country where functionality is the highest praise for almost anything.<\/blockquote>\n<p>I would imagine this is the first time a country uses <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/open_source-free_software-what_we_need_is_open_projects\/\">FOSS philosophy<\/a> as one of the building blocks for a national strategy.<\/p>\n<p>If you have the time, go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tehtavasuomelle.fi\/\">project website<\/a> and read the materials.

Because to provide user-friendly interaction with semantically enriched content, CMSs need better WYSIWYG editors and interaction models than currently available or even imagined.

Wikipedia says the following about literate programming:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Knuth, represents a move away from writing programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer, and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. Literate programs are written as an uninterrupted exposition of logic in an ordinary human language, much like the text of an essay, in which macros which hide abstractions and traditional source code are included. Literate programming tools are used to obtain two representations from a literate source file: one suitable for further compilation or execution by a computer, the \"tangled\" code, and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be \"woven\" from the literate source. While the first generation of literate programming tools were computer language-specific, the later ones are language-agnostic and exist above the programming languages.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><code>noweb.php<\/code> is able to facilitate this model of working by being able to extract program code from textual documents describing how the program ought to work. This document itself is such a description, and <code>noweb.php<\/code> PHP code can be generated from it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The inspiration for creating <code>noweb.php<\/code> comes from Jonathan Aquino's work on implementing the same with Python. See his <a href=\"http:\/\/jonaquino.blogspot.com\/2010\/04\/nowebpy-or-worlds-first-executable-blog.html\">world's first executable blog post<\/a> and the actual <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/JonathanAquino\/noweb.py\">noweb.py project on GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Download<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you're interested in doing literate programming with PHP, grab the software produced by this document from GitHub:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/noweb.php\">https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/noweb.php<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><code>noweb.php<\/code> requires PHP 5.3 or newer.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Usage<\/h2>\n\n<p><code>noweb.php<\/code> is a PHP tool that reads a text file with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Noweb#Noweb.27s_input\">noweb-style<\/a> annotated software code macros in it, parses it and writes the files defined in the document into the file system.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ noweb.php tangle README.txt\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The resulting code files will be written into the same directory where the document resides.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you just want to see what code files the document defines, you can also run:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ noweb.php list README.txt\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h2>Getting a file<\/h2>\n\n<p>When <code>noweb.php<\/code> starts, we check for the command line arguments to get a file.

A chunk is defined by a name inside <code>&lt;&lt;<\/code> and <code>&gt;&gt;=<\/code>, and it ends on a line containing just <code>@<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>For parsing the chunks we will need two regular expressions:<\/p>\n\n<pre id=\"chunk regular expressions\" title=\"chunk regular expressions\">\nprivate $chunk_start_regexp = '\/^&lt;&lt;([^&gt;]+)&gt;&gt;=\/';\nprivate $chunk_end_regexp = '\/^@$\/';\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>When reading a literate programming file, we handle it on line-by-line basis, keeping track of whether we're inside a chunk or documentation:<\/p>\n\n<pre id=\"reading the file\" title=\"reading the file\">\n$lines = file($filename);\n$chunk = null;\nforeach ($lines as $line)\n{\n    &lt;&lt;reading line of the file&gt;&gt;\n}\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>With each line of the document we first check if starts a chunk:<\/p>\n\n<pre id=\"reading line of the file\" title=\"reading line of the file\">\n$matches = array();\nif (preg_match($this-&gt;chunk_start_regexp, $line, $matches))\n{\n    \/\/ Entering a chunk\n    $chunk = $matches[1];\n    if (!isset($this-&gt;chunks[$chunk]))\n    {\n        $this-&gt;chunks[$chunk] = '';\n    }\n    &lt;&lt;markdownizing chunk start&gt;&gt;\n    continue;\n}\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>If this line did not start a chunk, and we're not inside a chunk we can ignore the line as it is documentation, not source code:<\/p>\n\n<pre id=\"reading line of the file\" title=\"reading line of the file\">\nif (is_null($chunk))\n{\n    &lt;&lt;markdownizing documentation line&gt;&gt;\n    continue;\n}\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>If this check passes we're inside a chunk of code.

Just to make your website editable you need to accept the web framework imposed by the system, the templating engine used by the system, and the editing tools used by the system. Want to have a better user interface? Be prepared to rewrite your whole website, and to the pain of having to migrate content between different storage systems.<\/p>\n<p>But none of this should be necessary. When web editing tools were more immature, it made sense for the same people to build the whole stack from database content models to web page generation and editing tools. But that was ten years ago, now we could do better.<\/p>\n<p>Here is how a traditional CMS looks like:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e03f6a5bcbe4223f6a11e0a60db5207a8570387038_cms-monolithic-approach.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"cms-monolithic-approach.png\" title=\"cms-monolithic-approach.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the whole system is a monolithic block. The CMS provides content storage, routing, templating, editing tools, the kitchen sink. Probably you're even tied to a particular relational database for content storage. Want to use a cool new editor like <a href=\"http:\/\/aloha-editor.org\/\">Aloha<\/a>, or a different templating engine, or maybe a trendy NoSQL storage back-end? You'll have to convince the whole CMS project or vendor to switch over.<\/p>\n<p>A much better picture would be something like the following:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e03f6a6cfe27003f6a11e0a60db5207a8570387038_cms-decoupled-approach.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"cms-decoupled-approach.png\" title=\"cms-decoupled-approach.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this scenario, the concept of Content Management is decoupled. There is a <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application\/\">content repository<\/a> that manages content models and how to store them. This could be something like <a href=\"http:\/\/jackrabbit.apache.org\/\">JCR<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/fosswiki.liip.ch\/display\/jackalope\/Home\">PHPCR<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/couchdb.apache.org\/\">CouchDB<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard2\/\">Midgard2<\/a>. Then there is a web framework, responsible of matching URL requests to particular content and generating corresponding web pages. This could be <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/\">Drupal<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/flow3.typo3.org\/\">Flow3<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/\">Django<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/codeigniter.com\/\">CodeIgniter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/midgardmvc_core\/blob\/master\/documentation\/index.markdown\">Midgard MVC<\/a>, or something similar. And finally there is the web editing tool. The web editing tool provides an interface for managing contents of the web pages. This includes functionalities like rich text editing, workflows and image handling.<\/p>\n<p>The web editing tools have traditionally been part of the web framework, the framework serving forms and toolbars to the user as part of the generated web pages. But with modern browsers you could throw forms out of the window and just <a href=\"http:\/\/aloha-editor.org\/\">make pages editable<\/a> as they are.<\/p>\n<h2>Common representation of content on HTML level<\/h2>\n<p>How would the communication between the web editing tool and the backend work, then?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e03f6a7c83d8dc3f6a11e0a60db5207a8570387038_cms-decoupled-communications.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"cms-decoupled-communications.png\" title=\"cms-decoupled-communications.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First of all, the web editing tool has to understand the contents of the page. It has to understand what parts of the page should be editable, and how they connect together. If there is a list of news for instance, the tool needs to understand it enough to enable users to add new news items. The easy way of accomplishing this is to add some semantic annotations to the HTML pages. These annotations could be handled via <a href=\"http:\/\/microformats.org\/\">Microformats<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.w3.org\/html5\/md\/\">HTML5 microdata<\/a>, but the most power lies with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RDFa\">RDFa<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>RDFa is a way to describe the meaning of particular HTML elements using simple attributes. For example:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;div <strong>typeof=\"http:\/\/rdfs.org\/sioc\/ns#Post\"<\/strong> <strong>about=\"http:\/\/example.net\/blog\/news_item\"<\/strong>&gt;<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0&lt;h1 <strong>property=\"dcterms:title\"<\/strong>&gt;News item title&lt;\/h1&gt;<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0&lt;div <strong>property=\"sioc:content\"<\/strong>&gt;News item contents&lt;\/div&gt;<br \/>&lt;\/div&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>Here we get all the necessary information for <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/using_rdfa_to_make_a_web_page_editable\/\">making a blog entry editable<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul><li><strong>typeof<\/strong> tells us the type of the editable object. On typical CMSs this would map to a content model or a database table<\/li>\n<li><strong>about<\/strong> gives us the identifier of a particular object. On typical CMSs this would be the object identifier or database row primary key<\/li>\n<li><strong>property<\/strong> ties a particular HTML element to a property of the content object. On a CMS this could be a database column<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>As a side effect, we also manage to make our page more <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/google-s_rich_snippets_will_lead_us_into_semantic_web\/\">understandable to search engines<\/a> and other semantic tools. So the annotations are not just needed for UI, but also for SEO.<\/p>\n<h2>Common representation of content on JavaScript level<\/h2>\n<p>Having contents of a page described via RDFa makes it very easy to extract the content model into JavaScript. We can have a common utility library for doing this, but we also should have a common way of keeping track of these content objects. Enter <a href=\"http:\/\/documentcloud.github.com\/backbone\/\">Backbone.js<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.<\/blockquote>\n<p>With Backbone, the content extracted from the RDFa-annotated HTML page is easily manageable via JavaScript. Consider for example:<\/p>\n<pre>objectInstance.set({title: 'Hello, world'});<br \/>objectInstance.save(null, {<br \/>  success: function(savedModel, response) {<br \/>    alert(\"Your article '\" + savedModel.get('title') + \"' was saved to server\");<br \/>  }<br \/>});<\/pre>\n<p>This JS would work across all the different CMS implementations. Backbone.js provides a<a href=\"http:\/\/documentcloud.github.com\/backbone\/#Sync\"> quite nice RESTful implementation<\/a> of communicating with the server with JSON, but it can be easily overridden with CMS-specific implementation by just implementing a new Backbone.Sync method. Look for example at the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jasondavies\/Backbone.localStorage\/blob\/master\/backbone.localStorage.js\">localStorage Backbone.js Sync implementation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>New possibilities for collaboration<\/h2>\n<p>Once the different Content Management Systems describe their content with RDFa, and provide an unified JavaScript API to it, lots of things become possible. While most systems probably want to have their own look-and-feel, still many functionalities can be shared. Consider for example:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Using browser's localStorage for storing drafts of content edited by user. Never lose content!<\/li>\n<li>Collaborative editing via <a href=\"http:\/\/wave-protocol.googlecode.com\/hg\/whitepapers\/operational-transform\/operational-transform.html\">XMPP<\/a> or WebSockets<\/li>\n<li>Versioning and undo<\/li>\n<li>Semantic enrichment of content using tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/stanbol\/\">Apache Stanbol<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>All of these would be quite hard to implement by an individual CMS project. But if we have a common JS layer available, the effort can be shared by all CMS projects implementing these ideas.<\/p>\n<p>There have been prior efforts at doing something similar. In the early 2000s, <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the-doubtful-future-of-oscom\/\">OSCOM<\/a> made the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zope-europe.org\/events\/0303\/oscomsprintzurich\">Twingle tool<\/a> that was able to edit and save content with multiple CMSs. Then there was the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atomenabled.org\/developers\/protocol\/\">Atom Publishing Protocol<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/neutron_protocol-separating_ui_from_the_cms\/\">Neutrol Protocol<\/a> efforts, and also <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services\">CMIS<\/a>. But all of these mandated that the systems would have to implement some particular server-side protocol. The advantage of the approach promoted here is that the only server-side change needed is adding RDFa annotations to HTML templates, and then the rest happens on JavaScript level.<\/p>\n<p>The new CMS interface we've built for Midgard2 already uses these concepts. Now here in the <a href=\"http:\/\/aloha-editor.org\/wiki\/Aloha_Editor_Dev_Con_11\">Aloha Editor Developer conference<\/a> we're <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/berit_jensen\/status\/40381611824381952\">talking with<\/a> Drupal and TYPO3 developers about rolling out the same ideas in their systems. Other systems and projects are also more than welcome to participate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> The work is underway to generalize the RDFa-Backbone.js bridge I originally wrote for Midgard Create. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/VIE\">find it on GitHub<\/a>.

The advantages for automatically generated bindings are quite obvious when compared to the situation with older Midgard versions where we had to maintain them manually. Unfortunately PHP didn't have GObject Introspection support, but that is about to change. <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.milkfarmsoft.com\/2011\/02\/gobject-for-php-new-bindings-project\/\">Alexey from the Midgard team writes<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These days, a lot of effort in GNOME community goes into <a href=\"http:\/\/live.gnome.org\/GObjectIntrospection\">GObject Introspection<\/a> project.

That\u2019s what PHP-GTK team had to do, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s quotation from project\u2019s web site:<\/p>\n<blockquote>The introspection project solves this by putting all of the metadata inside the GObject library itself, using annotations in the comments. This will lead to less duplicate work from binding authors, and a more reliable experience for binding consumers. Additionally, because the introspection build process will occur inside the GObject libraries themselves, a goal is to encourage GObject authors to consider shaping their APIs to be more binding friendly from the start, rather than as an afterthought.<\/blockquote>\n<p>So, \u201cintrospection\u201d branch aims to provide bindings for GObject Introspection infrastructure. The main entry point is <strong>GIRepository\\load_ns(\u2018Namespace\u2019)<\/strong> function, which creates php-counterparts of all classes, functions, constants of corresponding GObject namespace dynamically.

Our team had been doing the internal Midgard-based information systems at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stonesoft.com\/en\/\">Stonesoft<\/a>, but as parts of that company were being sold, our team would've been split up. So instead we started our own business with <a href=\"http:\/\/fi.linkedin.com\/in\/henrihovi\">Henri Hovi<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/haedong-kumdo.fi\/valokuvat\/photo\/1dfb814a77df8fcb81411df9a2ac960de8aca43ca43\/tag\/all\/jose\/\">Johannes Hentunen<\/a>, with the idea that our Midgard expertise would be useful to a wider market.<\/p>\n<h2>The best laid plans<\/h2>\n<p>The initial plans were made at a Starbucks on New York's JFK airport while waiting for a flight to Atlanta, but their realisation had to wait until I finished my military service on the latter half of 2000. When I got rid of the bazookas and uniforms, we registered the company, wrote some business plans and started looking for seed money to get our business started. We were quite young then, and it was interesting to run around Helsinki talking to investors.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e044345cc24cbc443411e0b06153d27d3672757275_bergie-presenting-2001.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"bergie-presenting-2001.png\" title=\"bergie-presenting-2001.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>How did these plans look like? Our initial idea was to get into the fashionable SaaS (or ASP, as it was known then) business by building collaboration tools on top of Midgard. The first product was a document store intended for the construction industry. With this system all plans and other documents related to a building project could be easily stored and accessed. This is <a href=\"http:\/\/replay.waybackmachine.org\/20010709190334\/http:\/\/www.nemein.com\/corporate\/nemein-info.pdf\">how we described ourselves<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Nemein Solutions is the leading provider of Open Source Midgard software for mobile collaboration and information management.<\/blockquote>\n<p>But as plans go, this had to soon change due to the IT bubble being burst. To quote <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder\">von Moltke<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength<\/blockquote>\n<p>In spring 2001 IT bubble burst, and we suddenly found ourselves sitting in the office with all our projects being abruptly frozen. Around the same time our seed investor got embroiled in some large-scale customs lawsuit, and so not much help was to be expected from them. This meant we couldn't continue with our original plans, and instead had to start generating cash flow, quickly. Luckily Midgard was (and is!) a quite capable web framework, and so we had the option of going into the CMS business.<\/p>\n<h2>Nadmin Studio<\/h2>\n<p>Midgard's user interfaces back then were not very appealing, and so our first task was to go shopping for the CMS UI. There were two good options available: Nadmin Studio from Hong Kong Linux Center, a web based CMS and small business networking tool running on top of Midgard, and a Windows-based Midgard editing tool from DataFlow. As we were much more of a Linux shop, we went with Nadmin. It was quite a cool system, a customized Red Hat Linux install that set up not only Midgard and the web user interface, but also things like LDAP and IMAP servers talking directly with the Midgard database. And it had a quite nice WYSIWYG editor for people writing content on the web pages. We quickly became their reseller for Finland. Yes, back then you could get Midgard in a box (and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/989581511\/in\/datetaken\/\">even CD<\/a>):<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e04434e895096e443411e0935c736b84ef660a660a_nadminstudio-box-tux.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"nadminstudio-box-tux.png\" title=\"nadminstudio-box-tux.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Having settled the tool question the next issue was finding clients. We took a list of hundred largest companies in Finland and basically called each of them, proposing a demo. We also approached several \"new media companies\" in order to see if they wanted a technical partner. Around these times our CEO <a href=\"http:\/\/fi.linkedin.com\/pub\/petri-kuusela\/1\/560\/972\">Petri Kuusela<\/a> also figured that<em> we'd be a lot more convincing consultants in sweaters instead of Hugo Boss suits<\/em>, and so the look of the company changed.<\/p>\n<p>Through these efforts we were able to get some of our first and longest-term customers, including this one:<\/p>\n<blockquote>HELSINKI, Jun 12th 2001 -- Nemein Solutions helps Everscreen Mediateam, a Finnish multimedia company implement the Nemein.net Content Manager product to power Motiva's web services. Everscreen's and Nemein's cooperation provides Motiva with up-to-date and easy to use web sites.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Around this time we moved from the small four-desk office in central Helsinki to a much bigger place in Haukilahti, Espoo. My time was mostly spent motorcycling from one demo to another, as our two sales guys kept me so busy that on most days I didn't have time for a lunch break, and much less for actually writing code. The cash flow generated there helped to keep things running, but as usual, possibilities for product development suffered. This is called <a href=\"http:\/\/discuss.joelonsoftware.com\/default.asp?joel.3.680507.33\">the Consulting Trap<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>...Once the consultancy money rolls in, it is hard to give up. Like an addiction.<br \/><br \/>I spent years thinking just six more months, then I'm going to quit and work on my \u00b5ISV project.<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Nemein.Net<\/h2>\n<p>Consulting isn't such a bad business to be in. As long as the things you do produce value for customers it can be lucrative and interesting. But still the idea of having actual products was kept alive, and a bit later we built Nemein.Net, a project management tool for consulting companies. We changed the business model a bit, instead of providing hosted services we leased some industrial-grade servers to our clients with the software pre-installed. A cluster of engineering companies bought that, and as far as I know some of them still run it. <a href=\"http:\/\/lwn.net\/Articles\/2289\/\">Datex-Ohmeda was another customer<\/a>, but they were later bought by General Electic.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"For our project work it is very important to reduce management overhead and enable real-time tracking of project status. The Nemein.Net Projects suite provides a good match for these criteria,\" says Bror-Eric Granfelt, R&amp;D Manager at Datex-Ohmeda.<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Free Software company<\/h2>\n<p>In 2004 we <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/2004-04-15-002\">open sourced the Nemein.Net suite, now renamed to OpenPSA<\/a>. This was done as part of the 5th anniversary celebrations of the Midgard project. By this time Nadmin Studio had also been <a href=\"http:\/\/lwn.net\/Articles\/43891\/\">GPLd and renamed to Aegir CMS<\/a>. So suddenly we were a pure Free Software company. We quickly started adopting MidCOM, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/updates\/2003-04-12-000\/\">emerging MVC framework for Midgard and PHP<\/a>. MidCOM was produced initially by the German ISP <a href=\"http:\/\/www.link-m.de\/\">Linksystem Muenchen<\/a>, but very soon Nemein was the primary contributor.<\/p>\n<p>The company structure changed, and we decided that instead of having a traditional office with desktop computers, it'd be better to be more location independent and work where our customers were. So we got a small office from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technopolis.fi\/business_services\/conference_and_video_meeting\/espoo\/innopoli_2\">Innopoli<\/a> business park mostly to facilitate <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/people\/rambo\/\">Rambo<\/a>, and the rest of our people were moving around. Once a week we had a coordination lunch meeting in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.everestyeti.fi\/en\/index.php\">Restaurant Mount Everest<\/a> to keep the group spirit going. Some of that <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/staff_meeting_in_the_park\/\">tradition has stayed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1df6fd5082c1aa46fd511df8eb03d0a5ffbbaa9baa9_20100604_009_small.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Staff meeting in a park\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Around this time we also started the switch on our workstations from HP's Linux laptops to MacBooks. This wasn't really a conscious strategy, but instead mandated by my laptop breaking a day or two before a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/sets\/72157604038349521\/\">training trip to South Africa<\/a>. Back then <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linux-laptop.net\/\">Linux on laptops<\/a> was still a quite cumbersome setup, and I needed a Unix machine where our software would run, quick. Later on I've returned to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_innovation-and_how_choice_is_not_always_good\/\">running Linux<\/a> on my own machines, but most of the company still works on OS X.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coss.fi\/en\">Finnish Centre for Open Source Solutions<\/a> (COSS) was formed in 2003, and we soon joined up. A forming network of free software companies in Finland was good for both publicity and getting new projects. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coss.fi\/node\/491\">OpenPSA gained a boost there<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Collaboration with Nemein went well. Right from the beginning they were able to state their views clearly and backed by facts. We immediately understood how OpenPSA works, what customizations would be needed, and how much they would cost. Unfortunately we cannot say the same of all other solution providers, says doctor Ville Ojanen.<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Dreams of networked business<\/h2>\n<p>Another interesting opportunity that came from the COSS network was the EU-funded <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/first-look-at-digital-business-ecosystem\/\">Digital Business Ecosystems project<\/a>. The project fit quite well in my view of the need for enabling cooperation between small companies in Europe, this time through having business systems talk to each other over a peer-to-peer network.<\/p>\n<p>To realise this dream we <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/how-openpsa-uses-dbe\/\">connected our OpenPSA system into the ecosystem<\/a>, enabling companies to fluidly share tasks, workflows and hour reports over the network. Unfortunately not much came out of that. A bit later the maintenance of the OpenPSA project was <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/free_software_at_work-openpsa2_is_making_a_return\/\">switched over to Content Control<\/a> from Germany.<\/p>\n<p>A later iteration of similar ideas was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajatus.info\/\">Ajatus<\/a>, an experimental project to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajatus.info\/documentation\/ajatus_manifesto\/\">build a \"personal CRM\"<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"Companies that don't realize their markets are now networked person-to-person, getting smarter as a result and deeply joined in conversation are missing their best opportunity.\" - The Cluetrain Manifesto, these 18.<br \/><br \/> Remember a time when you needed to share a document with a business partner, colleague or a customer? The CRM should make this easy without requiring complex IT integration setups or the disconnectivity of emailing files.<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Getting into position<\/h2>\n<p>Several Nemein people have been active <a href=\"http:\/\/routamc.org\/\">motorcycle travelers<\/a>. As all our projects were more or less visible on the web, this brough the question of location sharing into the picture. For the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deathmonkey.org\/\">Death Monkey project in 2006<\/a> we built a set of location-aware features that enabled us to visualize the location of each participant on a map, and easily calculate distances to Gibraltar.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e04438bb57f5ca443811e0b7f299cfb19e66486648_bergius-young-entrepreneur.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"bergius-young-entrepreneur.png\" title=\"bergius-young-entrepreneur.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At that time using maps on the web was also growing, and so we stepped into the emerging business of neogeography. Over the years we've evangelized the usage of <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/making_the_gnome_desktop_location-aware\/\">location information on Linux desktops<\/a>, built <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/halti-com_provides_contextual_product_recommendations\/\">weather-aware clothes catalogues<\/a>, facilitated publishing open data of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aalto.fi\/fi\/about\/contact\/\">campus maps<\/a> and made it easier to <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/buscatcher-never_miss_another_tram\/\">catch a tram<\/a>. This is still one of the areas online that I find most interesting.<\/p>\n<h2>Growth and mobility<\/h2>\n<p>Over the years Nemein's business has been growing at a steady pace. Now we have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bergie\/4820279827\/\">nice small office<\/a> in the Hietalahti area of Helsinki, and serve quite a bunch of interesting, <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/clients\/\">large Finnish customers<\/a> in the CMS space. A major milestone for the company was <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/aaa-important_milestone_for_nemein\/\">achieving AAA credit rating<\/a> back in 2007:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-fb8877ca83af11dc816fcf3d3210e1eae1ea\/nemein-aaa-bergie-joe-tm.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"AAA rating\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ignited by Apple's iPhone launch, the mobile ecosystem has been a very interesting area to operate in. To be part of it, we built the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/maemo-s_community_involvement_infrastructure_is_what_meego_needs\/\">community infrastructure for Maemo<\/a>, Nokia's emerging mobile Linux platform, and also got <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/me_on_meego\/\">involved in the MeeGo<\/a> project. But now in the age of <a href=\"http:\/\/bethesignal.org\/blog\/2011\/02\/11\/elopocalypse-nokia-chooses-microsoft\/\">burning platforms<\/a> the future of that business is in question.<\/p>\n<h2>The Midgard way<\/h2>\n<p>The Midgard content repository and web framework have been a constant core part of our business for the whole history of the company. Everything we've built has been running on top of it. Has this been a wise choice? In the course of ten years, the web landscape has changed quite a bit. While Midgard itself has stayed current through constant development and refinement, hundreds and hundreds of competing systems have risen up, some of them becoming very popular compared to us. And yet we have stayed the course.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e0443b57ae032c443b11e08df6cd11de31dab7dab7_midgard-team-in-suomenlinna.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"midgard-team-in-suomenlinna.png\" title=\"midgard-team-in-suomenlinna.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Midgard, especially in the latest iterations, is an excellent tool for running information-rich systems. It has a very nice user interface and an elegant web development framework. These are tools that I feel have lots of possibilities still ahead of them. Some of the design decisions done in the early days of the project, like integrated support for multi-site hosting, and for multilingual content, are things that now power some of our most important customer deployments<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time I've learned that especially for smaller open source projects like us, the monolithic \"all or nothing\" approach is not very healthy. Frameworks keep us apart, while libraries allow us to share our code and experiences. This is resulting to collaboration with other projects on many levels, from a <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/php-finally_getting_an_ecosystem\/\">shared PHP ecosystem<\/a> managed through the Apache Software Foundation, to common tools for <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/decoupling_content_management\/\">decoupling the Content Management experience<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iks-project.eu\/\">Linked Data<\/a> also plays a large role here.<\/p>\n<h2>To wrap it up<\/h2>\n<p>Ten years as an entrepreneur is a long path. Financially it may not have been as rewarding as we initially thought it would be, but experience-wise it has been astonishing. I've been part of building many challenging business-critical systems, learnt a lot of things, and given talks in dozens of conferences all around the world. It is hard to see as varied and interesting possibilities in regular employment.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the whole <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/people\/\">current Nemein team<\/a>, and the people who've been here before for all the awesome work done over these years.

The user interface itself is completely written in JavaScript, backed by the <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.iks-project.eu\/index.php\/VIE\">VIE<\/a> library produced by the IKS project, and the excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/aloha-editor.org\/\">Aloha HTML5 editor<\/a>.

For a while it looked like software freedom might be <a href=\"http:\/\/meego.com\/about\">one of the cornerstones<\/a> of the new world, but since then <a href=\"http:\/\/bethesignal.org\/blog\/2011\/02\/11\/elopocalypse-nokia-chooses-microsoft\/\">it has been shown<\/a> that the tech giants Apple and Microsoft, together with the American content industry, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement#Criticism\">will ensure<\/a> that this new environment is more tightly locked down than anything we've seen before.<br \/><br \/>These companies will have a say on who gets to create something, who to distribute it, and who to use it. Users will be 'protected from themselves' by enabling these devices to run only code approved by the company. We've already seen that this approval can be declined, or even retroactively withdrawn on a whim, and on grounds more political than technical.<br \/><br \/>If we want to ensure digital freedoms for ourselves, and for the people only now reaching across the digital divide, we must act. We must find ways to enable creativity to happen on these new devices. We need to find ways to enable people to create, distribute and use any software on their phones, regardless of what locked-down ecosystem their mobile operator pushed them into.<br \/><br \/>Luckily there is one programming environment, one runtime that even the most restrictive players haven't had the courage to lock down: <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2007\/10\/18\/the-web-is-the-platform\/\">the web<\/a>.

Angry words have been written, and I believe much of the tension arises from the situation with MeeGo. Suddenly many developers and projects feel much more marginalized than what the future looked like, <a href=\"http:\/\/bethesignal.org\/blog\/2011\/02\/11\/elopocalypse-nokia-chooses-microsoft\/\">pre-112<\/a>. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail before the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.desktopsummit.org\/\">Desktop Summit<\/a>, and we can again have beers and discuss things together.<\/p>\n<p>Cross-project collaboration is hard. I know. For many years I've been pushing for <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/geoclue_0-12_is_out-location_awareness_over_d-bus\/\">location-awareness<\/a> across desktops, for <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application\/\">using shared content repositories<\/a> instead of application-specific file formats or databases, and most recently for having a common client-side <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/decoupling_content_management\/\">data representation and manipulation layer<\/a> on content management systems. Some of these ideas have moved forward. Some others, less so.<\/p>\n<p>What is important to remember is that each project has their own use cases, user experience goals and set of selected technologies to build on. If a collaborative approach you propose doesn't fit those, it is highly unlikely that the project will adopt it. And there is nothing wrong with that.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of looking at the failures, we should think of the ways cross-desktop collaboration has moved forward. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Software\/dbus\">D-Bus<\/a> is pretty much everywhere now. A common way to handle signalling and API calls between processes is a big step<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/telepathy.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/\">Telepathy<\/a> provides a great real-time communications system on all desktops<\/li>\n<li>All projects seem a lot more UX-focused nowadays. Great examples are <a href=\"http:\/\/afaikblog.wordpress.com\/2011\/03\/01\/where-did-the-buttons-go\/\">window management<\/a> in GNOME Shell, <a href=\"http:\/\/techbase.kde.org\/Projects\/Silk\">web integration<\/a> in KDE, and better handling of <a href=\"http:\/\/design.canonical.com\/2011\/03\/quit\/\">quitting applications<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/design.canonical.com\/2011\/03\/introducing-overlay-scrollbars-in-unity\/\">scrolling in them<\/a> in Unity. These ideas are easy to transfer between projects<\/li>\n<li>There is work ongoing on <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gnome.org\/hughsie\/2011\/01\/24\/application-installer-miniconf-trip-report\/\">unifying application installers<\/a> between distributions. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Specifications\/open-collaboration-services\">Open Collaboration Services<\/a> is also useful here<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/wayland.freedesktop.org\/\">Wayland<\/a> shows great promise for simplifying the graphics layer on Linux desktops<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>So, if you want to get a specification accepted between projects, how to go about it?<\/p>\n<p>First of all, you should communicate early and clearly the use cases your specification aims for. And then there should be a reference implementation available, not only as a library, but also as something already integrated in your UX.<\/p>\n<p>If you want projects to actually use your reference implementation instead of building their own, then it is important to remove as many obstacles from adopting it as possible:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Use permissive licensing and try to avoid copyright assignments or other requirements potential users would find onerous<\/li>\n<li>Host the project <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/why_make_your_projects_properly_open-sustainability\/\">on neutral ground<\/a>. For web projects, Apache is quite a good home. For desktop projects, Freedesktop is probably the best option<\/li>\n<li>Use technologies that don't impose too many constraints. Libraries should be quite low-level, or provide D-Bus APIs that can be used with any system<\/li>\n<li>Avoid technology-specific dependencies. For example, KDE has found <a href=\"http:\/\/freedesktop.org\/wiki\/Software\/GeoClue\">GeoClue<\/a> hard to adopt because it uses GNOME-specific settings interfaces<\/li>\n<li>Talk with the other guys. If you're from the GNOME project, go to aKademy and give a talk, and if you're a KDE developer, go and talk in GUADEC. IRC isn't bad here either<\/li>\n<li>Finally, accept that not everybody will use your implementation. But if they at least implement the same ideas, then collaboration is still possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>And even if your ideas haven't been adopted by other projects, as long as your implementation solves the use case for you it hasn't been in vain.

Because of this, I was very happy to see the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/phpcr\">PHPCR project<\/a> start to provide <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/phpcr\/phpcr\/tree\/master\/src\/PHPCR\">a PHP port<\/a> of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Content_repository_API_for_Java\">Java Content Repository<\/a> interfaces. This is the way to achieve truly a vendor-independent content repository API.<\/p>\n<p>What is PHPCR, then? It is a set of PHP interfaces that define how to deal with a content repository. Instead of thinking about particular databases or file formats, you get a standard way to deal with content using a tree-based metaphor and query APIs. On top of this, *CR provides standard ways to handle access control, versioning, content creation and many other things depending on what the particular repository supports. The repositories provide ways for applications to check their capabilities and content model, so an application can adapt to various repositories used.<\/p>\n<p>TYPO3 and Symfony are already pushing strongly towards PHPCR, using <a href=\"http:\/\/jackrabbit.apache.org\/\">Apache Jackrabbit<\/a> via <a href=\"http:\/\/jackalope.github.com\/\">a PHP bridge<\/a> as the reference implementation. Jackrabbit is great because it provides support for all *CR features, but obviously at the cost of a Java dependency.

If you're working on PHP-based content management technologies, this event should be a very useful one to join or at least follow.<\/p>\n<p>What is a content repository?<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/what_is_a_content_repository\/\">Content Repository<\/a> is a programming interface for connecting with various persistent data stores. On the Java side, the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Content_repository_API_for_Java\">JCR specification<\/a> has gained quite a bit of traction, allowing for easy decoupling of a Content Management System from the actual storage implementation. On PHP side there have been several content repositories in use, like <a href=\"http:\/\/couchdb.apache.org\/\">Apache CouchDB<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/midgard2\/\">Midgard<\/a>, each with vendor-specific APIs.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/phpcr\">PHPCR<\/a> effort aims to provide a standard API that can be used by any PHP content management system to interface with any content repository. The first PHPCR implementation is <a href=\"http:\/\/jackalope.github.com\/\">Jackalope<\/a>, which allows PHP systems to use <a href=\"http:\/\/jackrabbit.apache.org\/\">Apache Jackrabbit<\/a> as their content store and eventually also will support direct storage. There is also a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/phpcr-midgard2\">Midgard PHPCR provider<\/a> in the works.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/uncled\/introduction-to-jcr\">described by<\/a> David Nuescheler, the advantages of using a standard content repository interface are:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Functional Definition of a \u201cContent Repository\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Common Vocabulary!<\/li>\n<li>No longer learn (dozens of) (ugly) proprietary APIs<\/li>\n<li>Write (mostly) portable code, for Document Management, Web Content Management, Source Code Control<\/li>\n<li>Compare Repository Functionality<\/li>\n<li>No more information silos and vendor Lock-in Content-Centric Infrastructure<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/blockquote>\n<p>If you're interested in the event, please <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.iks-project.eu\/index.php\/IKSContentRepositoryWorkshopSwitzerland#Attendees\">sign up on the wiki page<\/a>.

As I've gotten some questions about the laptop itself, I decided to write something about it.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the 11\" MacBook Air is the best computer I've ever had. I've always appreciated small and light laptops as I <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dopplr.com\/traveller\/bergie\">travel quite a bit<\/a>, but this one takes portability to a completely new level. The laptop weights only a kilogram, and is small enough to fit pretty much any bag. And it is pretty:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e071b17632db3071b111e09d42ef63fbf46c4b6c4b_macbook_air_3_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"macbook_air_3_2.jpg\" title=\"macbook_air_3_2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Funnily enough, it has a slower processor than my previous work laptop (1.4 GHz vs. 1.6 GHz), but the fast SSD makes a huge difference. Pretty much anything I do on the device feels faster. It appears <a href=\"http:\/\/brooksreview.net\/2011\/04\/mba-qs\/\">Brooks Review agrees<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>...my MacBook Air is the best Mac I have ever owned \u2014 hands down \u2014 no contest. I have had everything from the fabled 12\u2033 Powerbook G4 to a pimped out Mac Pro \u2014 the MacBook Air takes the cake here. It is incredibly fast for 95% of everything that I do and the screen resolution is amazing give the small footprint of the machine. The size and weight of the machine still amazes me every time I touch it.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Battery life is also <a href=\"http:\/\/osxdaily.com\/2010\/10\/30\/macbook-air-2010-battery-life\/\">quite good<\/a>, with Linux giving me about 3-4 hours per charge. This could obviously be better, and I dream of the 10+ hours an Arm processor would give.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Linux?<\/h2>\n<p>Why do I run Linux on the system? First of all, I appreciate the <a href=\"http:\/\/fsfe.org\/about\/basics\/freesoftware.en.html\">software freedom<\/a>. I also love the predictable release cycles that Ubuntu and GNOME give me: every six months there is a new release with a set of features announced early on. And since <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/\">we<\/a> deploy our software <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/nemein_is_going_to_ubuntu_server\/\">on Ubuntu<\/a>, my own development environment has automatically the same set of packages and versions available. Midgard, Node.js, etc. are\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/cloudhead.io\/2011\/04\/18\/why-osx-doesnt-cut-it\/\">all available from the repositories<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I also like GNOME's <a href=\"http:\/\/gnome3.org\/\">focus on simplicity<\/a>. Unlike OS X, the user interface has very few unnecessary elements, and the desktop itself has been designed to let me focus on the task at hand, minimizing distractions.<\/p>\n<p>Installing Ubuntu on the system is <a href=\"http:\/\/askubuntu.com\/questions\/10561\/how-to-install-on-a-macbook-air-3-2-without-an-external-cd-drive\">not exactly trivial<\/a>, but after a bit of setup everything works as it should: suspending, wireless, webcam, everything. And boot times are also pleasantly fast.\u00a0Compared to previous Ubuntu versions, network acquisition after resume is also very fast, comparable to OS X.<\/p>\n<h2>Gripes<\/h2>\n<p>As said, battery life could be better. Ten hours would give me trouble-free working environment when traveling, as now I often have to prioritize when to use the computer and for what in fear that no power outlet is available.<\/p>\n<p>I also hate the display adapters Apple forces us to buy and carry around. I give a lot of presentations, and this is another piece of equipment to accidentally leave home. Why not just go VGA or HDMI?<\/p>\n<p>In both of these aspects the similarly compact <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nokia_Booklet_3G\">Nokia Booklet<\/a> would've been better. Unfortunately it has been a while since that \"business netbook\" was released and there has been no word of newer versions.<\/p>\n<p>Another gripe is related to the stability of the <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/~gnome3-team\/+archive\/gnome3\/+packages\">GNOME3 PPA release<\/a> for Natty. There are some regressions compared to stock Ubuntu. I hope that will be eventually fixed now that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ubuntu.com\/ubuntu\">Natty is officially out<\/a>. Shame that Canonical wanted to <a href=\"http:\/\/unity.ubuntu.com\/\">do their own thing<\/a> instead of going with GNOME.<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/techno-optimism_and_free_software\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Techno-optimism and free software","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2011-05-04 13:15:25","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.locusmag.com\/Perspectives\/2011\/05\/cory-doctorow-techno-optimism\/\">Cory Doctorow on Locus<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>To understand techno-optimism, it\u2019s useful to look at the free software movement, whose ideology and activism gave rise to the GNU\/Linux operating system, the Android mobile operating system, the Firefox and Chrome browsers, the BSD Unix that lives underneath Mac OS X, the Apache web-server and many other web- and e-mail-servers and innumerable other technologies.

During the time we also discussed some other code reuse, like utilizing parts of the <a href=\"http:\/\/symfony.com\/\">Symfony2<\/a> framework in Midgard. The Liip guys mentioned <a href=\"http:\/\/silex-project.org\/\">Silex<\/a>, a cool micro-framework written on top of Symfony2. It greatly resembles the <a href=\"http:\/\/expressjs.com\/\">ExpressJS framework<\/a> that we already use in some of our <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.iks-project.eu\/index.php\/VIE\/Palsu\">Node.js projects<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a simple example of registering a route and displaying something when it is called:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;?php\n$app-&gt;get('\/hello\/{name}', function($name) { \n    return \"Hello $name\"; \n});<\/pre>\n<p>Compare this to same in Express:<\/p>\n<pre>app.get('\/hello\/:name', function(req, res){\n    res.send('Hello ' + req.params.name);\n});<\/pre>\n<p>As we prefer to run Midgard on top of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/indeyets\/appserver-in-php\">AppServer-in-PHP<\/a> instead of regular mod_php, a good first step with Symfony was to figure out how it would integrate with persistent PHP processes.<\/p>\n<p>It seems this is indeed easy. In couple of hours, without prior Symfony2 experience, I wrote a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/Silex\/blob\/master\/src\/Silex\/Extension\/AiPExtension.php\">simple Silex extension<\/a> that handles the communications between Silex\/Symfony and AiP. An <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/Silex\/tree\/master\/example\/AiP\">example for using it<\/a> can be found from my GitHub fork.<\/p>\n<p>Running it under siege shows one of the benefits of AiP. While the first request is a bit slower, the later ones are really fast as the application server will load the Symfony classes only once:<\/p>\n<pre>HTTP\/1.0 200   0.03 secs:      11 bytes ==&gt; \/hello\/World\nHTTP\/1.0 200   0.00 secs:      11 bytes ==&gt; \/hello\/World\nHTTP\/1.0 200   0.01 secs:      11 bytes ==&gt; \/hello\/World\nHTTP\/1.0 200   0.00 secs:      11 bytes ==&gt; \/hello\/World<\/pre>\n<p>AppServer integration to Symfony needs to be cleaned up before it is ready for general consumption. But this example already shows that there is quite a bit of potential in the combination.

I've built both software and community services for it. As a Maemo enthusiast, I've also been following MeeGo with interest, and am helping to build some of the project infrastructure there as well. But I do not speak with the authority of the MeeGo project, and what is written below is my personal view into what MeeGo is.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>After the recent <a href=\"http:\/\/sf2011.meego.com\/\">San Francisco MeeGo Conference<\/a> there has been surprisingly much negative reporting about MeeGo, mostly centered at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latestnewsin.com\/meegos-state-of-development-was-an-oh-shit-moment-for-nokia\/\">Nokia's MeeGo story<\/a>. While Nokia's strategy changes are unfortunate, much of the reporting around it appears to come from misunderstanding what MeeGo is about.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many see MeeGo just as <em>Android without Java<\/em>, but it is much more, as I'll explain here.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Industrial Linux<\/h2>\n\n<p>MeeGo is much more than just handsets or tablets. It is an attempt at creating a standardized industrial Linux distribution that can be used anywhere from in-vehicle infotainment devices to TVs to, indeed, handsets.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is a true open and collaborative environment, managed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxfoundation.org\/\">Linux Foundation<\/a>. The <a href=\"https:\/\/meego.com\/about\/governance\">governance model<\/a> is there to ensure that MeeGo stays a vendor-neutral platform that anybody can build their products on top.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many device segments have very long development, and especially usage times. For this MeeGo has a predictable release schedule of a major release every six months, and <a href=\"https:\/\/meego.com\/about\/roadmaps\">a roadmap<\/a> kept by the Technical Steering Group.<\/p>\n\n<p>If MeeGo succeeds in this, you will be using it in your TV, in your car stereo, and at the back of an airline seat. But in most of these situations you won't be able to know that it is MeeGo. It is simply there to make building products faster and cheaper for the manufacturer.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Openness<\/h2>\n\n<p>As I argued in my earlier piece <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/open_source-free_software-what_we_need_is_open_projects\/\">Open Source? Free Software? What we need is Open Projects<\/a>, being an open platform is much more than just the licensing terms of the code. There needs to be transparency into the development process, a clear procedure on how to participate and much more. And of course licensing has to be such that the participants can actually use the results in whatever they're doing.<\/p>\n\n<p>For this, most of <a href=\"https:\/\/meego.com\/about\/licensing-policy\">MeeGo is licensed<\/a> under permissive terms, like the GNU LGPL and BSD-style licenses.<\/p>\n\n<p>But indeed, the other aspects of openness are more important. With MeeGo you can see every commit happening on Gitorious, and you can see the bugs and features being worked out in a public Bugzilla.<\/p>\n\n<p>MeeGo as a project is still quite young, and many participants are still learning how to work in the open. This has lead to <a href=\"http:\/\/lwn.net\/Articles\/444567\/\">some issues in project transparency<\/a>. But hopefully those are now getting resolved.<\/p>\n\n<h2>User Experience<\/h2>\n\n<p>MeeGo allows anyone to build their own user experience on top of the platform. Actually, this is expected of any serious manufacturer. Sure, there are some reference UXs available, including Tablet, Handset and Netbook, but none of these are quite product-ready, and are not necessarily even intended to be.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of this it is quite funny to see reviews of the reference UXs. They're not the ones most devices will run, though obviously some manufacturers or community members are going to use them anyway. A full MeeGo product will look and feel like something completely different.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is not like Android manufacturers adding their own skins. With MeeGo anybody has the full freedom to build a complete user experience that suits their device, branding and other goals. The whole platform has been built to allow this sort of differentiation, without a risk of fragmenting the ecosystem. I'll explain the fragmentation question soon.<\/p>\n\n<p>Actually, the freedom of defining your own user interface is big enough that both Android and WebOS could theoretically be rebased on top of MeeGo to be just different MeeGo UXs. Obviously they would need to allow running MeeGo-compliant Qt applications in addition to ones written for them directly, but that is minor detail. WebOS already ships Qt, so it isn't even that far from this. Similarly, KDE or GNOME could run as MeeGo UXs.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Compliance<\/h2>\n\n<p>At the core of MeeGo there is <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.meego.com\/Quality\/Compliance\">a set of compliance rules<\/a>. Being Open Source, anybody can take MeeGo, modify it, and run it on their devices. But only if their implementation passes MeeGo compliance it can be called MeeGo.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Device Compliance<\/em> is a set of rules that ensures any MeeGo-compliant software can run on a particular device. <em>Application Compliance<\/em> similarly ensures an app can be installed and run on any MeeGo-compliant device.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both of these sets of compliance rules have automated tests that anybody can run. So, between non-compliant MeeGo-related software there may be fragmentation, but anything branded MeeGo (and therefore compliant) must be fully compatible.<\/p>\n\n<h2>App Stores and business models<\/h2>\n\n<p>MeeGo is an open source project, not a company. This means it comes without strings attached, compliance rules aside. There are no limitations on the business model of a MeeGo device manufacturer, no mandatory online services or app stores to enable, and no royalty payments.<\/p>\n\n<p>With this, each vendor can decide what they want to enable their users to do with the device. An embedded device might have no concept of installable applications, a tablet might come with the vendor's own app store.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those who do not want to go through trouble of building their own developer ecosystems and app stores, there are some generic solutions available in the MeeGo sphere:<\/p>\n\n<p>Intel's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.appup.com\/applications\/index\">AppUp<\/a> is a \"white label\" app store. This means that a device manufacturer, or even retailer or operator can get an instance of AppUp with their own branding and a revenue sharing deal with Intel. Developers submit software only once and it will be available on all the different branded AppUps.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the more open side, there is also the upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.meego.com\/MeeGo_Apps\">MeeGo Community Apps<\/a>, a fully community driven \"store\" of free software written for MeeGo. It comes with its own, OCS-compatible client application, a web frontend, and clear set of <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/application_quality_assurance_in_linux_distributions\/\">crowdsourced app quality assurance<\/a> processes. The similarly handled Maemo Downloads has served over 80 million downloads for the Nokia N900, so the user and developer interest is clearly there.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The future of MeeGo<\/h2>\n\n<p>At this early stage of the project it is hard to make predictions, but there are many things MeeGo gets right. I think it has a bright future ahead of it, especially in more specialized devices. There the shared infrastructure and clear development schedule give manufacturers substantial advantages in both development time and cost.<\/p>\n\n<p>Product development times in the embedded sector are quite long, and it may well take years before we'll see MeeGo in a airline multimedia system. But if the project shows the necessary durability and longevity, this will eventually happen. Now many of those systems run on customized Linux distributions that their manufacturers have to spend quite a bit of money to maintain. MeeGo removes that problem, and allows easier collaboration through the compliance rules.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for consumer devices like tablets and handsets, that area mostly requires there to be a vendor that wants to properly differentiate itself from the grey masses of the Android ecosystem. MeeGo provides all the necessary tools on both systems side and user interface development to make that happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently there are many different ideas floating around on how to build user experiences on connected devices. There is the \"wall of apps\" approach of iPhone, there are the fully cloud-connected WebOS and Android approaches, and now Microsoft is also starting to enter the game with their own ideas.<\/p>\n\n<p>I don't think the \"post-PC\" world is yet complete. What MeeGo gives is a fast way to build products differentiating from that crowd. It just needs companies who are willing to go for it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The next couple of years will be quite interesting.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_create_and_vie_in_the_aloha_editor_conference\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Midgard Create and VIE in the Aloha Editor conference","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2011-06-07 00:53:46","atom:content":"<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aloha-editor.org\/wiki\/index.php\/Aloha_Editor_Dev_Con_SanFrancisco_11\">Aloha Editor Developer Conference<\/a> is happening this week in <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.hackerdojo.com\/w\/page\/25437\/FrontPage\">Hacker Dojo<\/a>, Mountain View.

There are lots of good applications written in the language, but there is very little code sharing between different projects, mainly because of framework incompatibilities, but also because of quite a strong <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Not_Invented_Here\">NIH<\/a> culture.<\/p>\n\n<p>But there are also bright points. I've recently seen lots of exchange of ideas, and even potential code sharing between some communities including Symfony2, Midgard, TYPO3 and eZ Publish. Much of the vision in these systems is similar, as are many of the engineering principles. When everybody uses reasonable object-oriented design, namespaces, and test-driven development, it is much easier to share.<\/p>\n\n<p>If I had to list three areas where there is most potential for collaboration, these would be:<\/p>\n\n<h2>Content model on the browser: VIE and RDFa<\/h2>\n\n<p>The age of communicating with your web audience via <em>forms<\/em> is almost over, and it is time to evolve. HTML5 includes support for the <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.whatwg.org\/the-road-to-html-5-contenteditable\">contentEditable<\/a> attribute which allows rich editing interaction straight on the pages, and there are cool editors supporting that, including <a href=\"http:\/\/aloha-editor.org\/\">Aloha Editor<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jejacks0n\/mercury#readme\">Mercury<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To do proper front-end editing, your CMS and the JavaScript environment have to agree on the content model. Fortunately there is a great solution for this: just annotate your content with some RDFa.<\/p>\n\n<p>Having RDFa on a page allows the browser to understand the content. What is a collection of blog posts for instance, and what is the title of a blog post. With this, my VIE library will provide you with a nice in-browser content management API based on <a href=\"http:\/\/documentcloud.github.com\/backbone\/\">Backbone.js<\/a>. Getting there is easy:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Annotate your pages with RDFa<\/li>\n<li>Include <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/VIE\">vie.js<\/a> to the pages<\/li>\n<li>Implement <a href=\"http:\/\/documentcloud.github.com\/backbone\/#Sync\">Backbone.sync<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>This allows a great deal of <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/decoupling_content_management\/\">decoupling in the CMS stack<\/a>. Suddenly the server side just has to worry about content management and page generation, and newer in-browser technologies can be used for actual content authoring.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using RDFa annotations in your content comes also with another benefit: suddenly your pages themselves are an API into your content model. And search engines can understand and present your content better.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about this, <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/midgard_create_and_vie_in_the_aloha_editor_conference\/\">watch my talk<\/a> from the Aloha Editor Dev Con.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Content persistence and retrieval: PHPCR<\/h2>\n\n<p>Historically, all CMSs have implemented persistence in their own way. There have been systems using relational databases like MySQL, systems providing their own content repository APIs like Midgard, and also some systems just using XML and the file system. This has reduced integration and code re-use possibilities between systems. In the Java world, a solution exists for this: the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Content_repository_API_for_Java\">Java Content Repository<\/a> standard (JCR).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now JCR has been ported to PHP. <a href=\"http:\/\/phpcr.github.com\/\">PHPCR<\/a> provides a standard interface for all content management needs, and has multiple back-ends available. Depending on your deployment needs, you could store your content into a relational database, into Apache Jackrabbit, or into for example MongoDB.<\/p>\n\n<p>PHPCR is great in that you can start small: just model your content with a simple, filesystem-like tree of nodes and properties. Then when you need it, a wealth of functionality is available. Versioning? Query builders? Access control? It is all there for you to use. And, depending on the PHPCR back-end, you'll have the ability to scale up to insane amounts of content.<\/p>\n\n<p>While I've advocated <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application\/\">using content repositories<\/a> for years now, this is the first time PHP has a true standardized, vendor-neutral API for it. And PHPCR is even being integrated <a href=\"http:\/\/java.net\/jira\/browse\/JSR_333-28\">into the JCR specification<\/a>, eventually making it an official standard.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/farm7.static.flickr.com\/6053\/5915517564_ba20056559.jpg\" alt=\"PHPCR discussion in Sursee, Switzerland\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Adoption is also picking up. Yesterday I was in a meeting where we had developers from TYPO3, Symfony2, Doctrine and Midgard discussing issues and solutions in the content repository space. I just hope the other projects also pick this specification up.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Improving performance: AppServer-in-PHP<\/h2>\n\n<p>Of the three, this is probably the most controversial idea. Traditionally PHP is run as a scripting environment on a regular web server, like Apache or Nginx. In such setup, when the server receives a request, it passes it on to the PHP environment. The PHP environment loads all the code needed to fulfill the request, runs it, sends the response back, and unloads everything loaded.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is fine when PHP is being used in the way Rasmus originally intended, as a simple display layer. But nowadays most of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sitepoint.com\/rasmus-lerdorf-php-frameworks-think-again\/\">PHP runs on a big framework<\/a>, whether it is MVC or something custom like Drupal. And loading and then discarding a whole framework for each request is simply insane.<\/p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/indeyets\/appserver-in-php\">AppServer-in-PHP<\/a> (AiP), you have an environment where even a big framework can perform. AiP provides you with a full server environment for PHP, <em>written in PHP<\/em>. In this setup, your framework is loaded when the server boots up, and then each request just runs the request processing part of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aloha-editor.org\/wiki\/Aloha_Editor_Dev_Con_SanFrancisco_11\">San Francisco Aloha Dev Con<\/a> we ported TYPO3 to run on AiP, and the performance results where staggering. A simpler request with not much I\/O would run 3-4 times faster than the same code on regular PHP setup, and an I\/O -intensive request would still be <em>twice as fast<\/em>. AiP can't do much about I\/O performance, but at least the cost of having a framework is greatly reduced.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, AppServer-in-PHP is something any developer running web services with a PHP framework should consider. It is also a great way for framework developers to see if they have request isolation problems in their design.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This post has been written in the <a href=\"http:\/\/t3dd11.typo3.org\/\">TYPO3 Developer Days 2011<\/a> event where I was invited to discuss these ideas, and also help run the RDFa part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/jocrau\/semantic-typo3\">TYPO3 Goes Semantic<\/a> workshop.<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/php_and_gobject_introspection\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"PHP and GObject Introspection","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2011-07-26 12:15:01","atom:content":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/live.gnome.org\/GObjectIntrospection\">GObject Introspection<\/a> is one of the hidden jewels of the <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.gnome.org\/platform-overview\/stable\/\">GNOME stack<\/a>: you write a library in C or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vala_%28programming_language%29\">Vala<\/a>, and it becomes automatically available to <a href=\"https:\/\/live.gnome.org\/GObjectIntrospection\/Users\">a wide variety<\/a> of languages and runtimes, including <a href=\"https:\/\/live.gnome.org\/PyGObject\">Python<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/live.gnome.org\/Gjs\">JavaScript<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/live.gnome.org\/JGIR\">Java<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.kde.org\/node\/4444\">Qt<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now I would like to bring GObject Introspection to PHP.

But what I haven't talked about is convergence in the area of PHP frameworks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Frameworks are generally problematic concerning <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_cross-project_collaboration\/\">cross-project collaboration<\/a>, as most of the code written against a particular framework tends to run only on that framework. If things are <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/decoupling_content_management\/\">properly decoupled<\/a>, and most of the logic is in generic libraries, this doesn't matter so much. But still, having a common framework most of the code is written for helps, as can be seen <a href=\"http:\/\/rubyonrails.org\/\">in the Ruby community<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, to advance this goal, we in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard Community<\/a> have <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.midgard-project.org\/pipermail\/dev\/2011-July\/003022.html\">made a decision<\/a> to start aligning our PHP code <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.midgard-project.org\/pipermail\/dev\/2011-July\/003016.html\">to Symfony2<\/a>. The <a href=\"http:\/\/symfony.com\/blog\/symfony-2-0\">ideas behind SF2<\/a> are quite compatible with our views:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Symfony2 embraces standards<\/em>: First, Symfony2 is willingly centered around the HTTP specification (just have a look at the built-in HTTP reverse proxy). Then, we are embracing the PHP standards: PHPUnit, namespaces, PSR-0 autoloader, ... That makes Symfony2 easily interoperable with many other great PHP libraries.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><em>Symfony2 is decoupled<\/em>: Beside being a full-stack framework, Symfony2 is also a set of decoupled and cohesive components; Symfony2 is made of 21 components that can be used as standalone libraries: they have their own Git repositories, and they are all available as PEAR packages.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>For us this alignment means making sure code written for MidCOM and Midgard MVC, our two PHP frameworks runs properly under Symfony2, and filling various functionality gaps that exist between our frameworks and SF2.<\/p>\n\n<p>I believe this to be a great opportunity for both communities. Especially for Midgard users this brings a great promise of future functionality coupled with full backwards compatibility.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are some very early results of this collaboration:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Symfony2 can now be <em>run on AppServer-in-PHP<\/em> with our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/MidgardAppServerBundle\">AppServerBundle<\/a>.

FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.<\/blockquote>\n<p>Basically the idea here is to simplify managing the control flow of software: what data goes where, what happens then, etc. with the goal of making software more understandable. With NoFlo you can go and peek under the hood of a running piece of software, see where data is going to, and even rewire some connections if you want to.<\/p>\n<p>The project is still in reasonably early stages, but it is already used in at least one real-life deployment. Here are some sneak peeks:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e0c03da3d93d7ec03d11e0ad7493d9595d183c183c_noflo-shell-small.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"noflo-shell-small.png\" title=\"noflo-shell-small.png\" \/>:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e0c03dc1eb3d1cc03d11e0853e692a724efbc6fbc6_noflo-gui-small.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"noflo-gui-small.png\" title=\"noflo-gui-small.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you're interested, follow the progress on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/noflo\">my GitHub repo<\/a>, or subscribe to the <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/flow-based-programming\">Flow-Based Programming mailing list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the spirit of Desktop Summit, it would be interesting to talk how these workflows would fit into the concept of a free software desktop.<\/p>"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/some_notes_from_desktop_summit_2011\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Some notes from Desktop Summit 2011","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2011-08-11 16:18:35","atom:content":"<p>As usual, <a href=\"https:\/\/desktopsummit.org\/\">Desktop Summit 2011<\/a> has been a lot of fun.

As <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/noflo\">NoFlo<\/a> builds quite heavily on EventEmitter, I decided to see how far the PHP port could be taken.<\/p>\n\n<p>As result, there is now <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/phpflo\">PhpFlo<\/a>, a flow-based programming environment for PHP.<\/p>\n\n<p>Example of how to define and run a flow (you can also use <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/phpflo\/blob\/master\/examples\/linecount\/count.json\">a JSON format<\/a> for this):<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>\/\/ Add nodes to the graph\n$graph = new PhpFlo\\Graph(\"linecount\");\n$graph-&gt;addNode(\"Read File\", \"ReadFile\");\n$graph-&gt;addNode(\"Split by Lines\", \"SplitStr\");\n$graph-&gt;addNode(\"Count Lines\", \"Counter\");\n$graph-&gt;addNode(\"Display\", \"Output\");\n\n\/\/ Add connections between nodes\n$graph-&gt;addEdge(\"Read File\", \"out\", \"Split by Lines\", \"in\");\n$graph-&gt;addEdge(\"Read File\", \"error\", \"Display\", \"in\");\n$graph-&gt;addEdge(\"Split by Lines\", \"out\", \"Count Lines\", \"in\");\n$graph-&gt;addEdge(\"Count Lines\", \"count\", \"Display\", \"in\");\n\n\/\/ Kick-start the process by sending filename to Read File\n$graph-&gt;addInitial($fileName, \"Read File\", \"source\");\n\n\/\/ Make the graph \"live\"\n$network = PhpFlo\\Network::create($graph);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The flow consists of processes, or instances simple \"black box\" components that have their own defined input and output ports. Program logic is defined by making connections between them. Here is a simple component that reads the contents of a file:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace PhpFlo\\Component;\nuse PhpFlo\\Component;\nuse PhpFlo\\Port;\nclass ReadFile extends Component\n{\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this-&gt;inPorts['source'] = new Port();\n        $this-&gt;outPorts['out'] = new Port();\n        $this-&gt;outPorts['error'] = new Port();\n\n        $this-&gt;inPorts['source']-&gt;on('data', array($this, 'readFile'));\n    }\n\n    public function readFile($data)\n    {\n        if (!file_exists($data)) {\n            $this-&gt;outPorts['error']-&gt;send(\"File {$data} doesn't exist\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $this-&gt;outPorts['out']-&gt;send(file_get_contents($data));\n        $this-&gt;outPorts['out']-&gt;disconnect();\n    }\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>I hope people find this system useful.

Tablets may not be good for writing, but they are good, probably better than PCs for a lot of other things. And it turns out, people want to be doing these other things.<\/p>\n<p>MG Siegler from TechCrunch has <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/09\/02\/post-pc-has-nothing-to-do-with-windows\/\">a great post on the subject<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...I\u2019ve been trained over time to think that the traditional PC is the way to do these things whether it\u2019s for work or play. That\u2019s simply not true. The tablet form factor is so. much. better. when you don\u2019t have to do an excessive amount of typing. And during downtime, when I use a computer like a more regular human being, I\u2019ve found that\u2019s often...<\/p>\n<p>Computing is changing. That\u2019s just about the most obvious statement ever. We\u2019ve been seeing this for years with the rise of the smartphones. But <em>traditional<\/em> computing is changing as well. As in, people are abandoning PCs for these newer devices. And this will keep happening.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>My experience conforms with this. I rarely use my laptop outside of the work context of <em>writing code<\/em>, instead preferring to use the tablet with its great ergonomics, portability and long battery life. On some of my previous trips I noticed that already more than half of people sitting in airport lounges use a tablet instead of a laptop. Not bad for a product category that has existed in a mainstream manner for less than two years. <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the_universal_communicator\/\">Nokia's internet tablets<\/a> blazed the trail years earlier, but were never marketed outside the geekdom.<\/p>\n<p>Now, much of the attention in the tablet world has been focused on the couple of platforms that are winning in popularity, and therefore have most of the apps. But regardless of how well Apple and Google play their cards, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.asymco.com\/2011\/07\/06\/the-post-pc-era-will-be-a-multi-platform-era\/\">the post-PC world will be a multiplatform one<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>About a week after I got my webOS-powered TouchPad, HP went and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/gadgetlab\/2011\/08\/hp-webos-tablet-touchpad\">killed the product<\/a>. Yet this hasn't made the device useless. As <a href=\"http:\/\/paulrouget.com\/e\/mobilewebapps\/\">Paul Rouget recently found out<\/a>, <em>as long as you have a good browser, your device will be relevant<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people can't or don't want to use Native Apps. Because their phones don't have Apps, or because there is just no good Apps for what they want to do, or because, well, because they don't need to...<\/p>\n<p>While in the Western world we were looking at Apple bringing pretty Apps in an expensive device, in the Eastern world, Opera was bringing a working web browser to all the existing devices.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This is the big opportunity for free software to remain relevant in an environment of highly-locked devices. Much of the web already runs on free components, and by using the web as <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/the_universal_runtime\/\">a universal runtime<\/a> we can bypass almost any platform restrictions. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paulgraham.com\/road.html\">As Paul Graham wrote<\/a> back in 2001, <em>no one can break web applications without breaking browsing<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The world of publishing is starting to understand this. Their revenue models can't take the heavy control that vendors like Apple imposes, and so <a href=\"https:\/\/read.amazon.com\/about\">Amazon's Kindle<\/a> is a web app, and <a href=\"http:\/\/apps.ft.com\/ftwebapp\/\">so is Financial Times<\/a>. That<em> \"Next year HTML5 will replace native apps\" is the new \"Next year will be the year of Linux on the desktop\"<\/em> is <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonlech\/status\/110598881049452545\">already a Twitter joke<\/a>, but there is certainly some movement in this direction. And interestingly, the Linux desktop is actually <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gnome.org\/xan\/2011\/08\/31\/web-application-mode-in-gnome-3-2\/\">becoming more web-savvy<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jonnor.com\/2011\/04\/introducing-maliit-on-screen-keyboard-in-gnome-3\/\">touch-friendly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are clearly sweet spots for something to be a web app, or for it to be a native application. Similarly, there are different situations where tablets will be the appropriate tool, and where PCs are. The tablet context will be more like this:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e0d7d53922345ed7d511e0af7669d1946e55d455d4_tablet-breakfast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"tablet-breakfast.jpg\" title=\"tablet-breakfast.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Than this:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/static\/1\/1e0d7d2eeae653ed7d211e0ad084b49cc799d7c9d7c_ipad-workstation.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"ipad-workstation.jpg\" title=\"ipad-workstation.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The heavy lifting is a better fit for a system designed for that.

And like any scared organism, they lash out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many of their plans to make web competitive against native development environments are good, there is indeed much to improve in the stack.

This is not the way <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_cross-project_collaboration\/\">to collaborate<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider some of their recent efforts:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.chromium.org\/spdy\/spdy-whitepaper\">SPDY<\/a>, a protocol to replace HTTP which Web is built on. Currently only supported by Chrome, which uses it to talk to several Google services<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.2ality.com\/2011\/09\/google-dart.html\">Dart<\/a>, their JavaScript-killer which recently surfaced through a <a href=\"http:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=2980267\">leaked email<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/manu.sporny.org\/2011\/false-choice\/\">Microdata and Schema.org<\/a> that seek to replace last ten years of semantic web development with a spec cooked up by couple of big vendors in secret<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These - together with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_SQL_Database\">WebSQL<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/nativeclient\/wiki\/NativeClientInGoogleChrome\">NaCl<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmproject.org\/\">WebM<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/speed\/webp\/\">WebP<\/a> - mean that Google has active efforts to replace practically every layer of the web (except HTML itself) with something of their own design.<\/p>\n\n<p>The way all of these were introduced bears strong reminders of how Microsoft tried to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish\">embrace, extend, and extinguish<\/a> the web in late 90s. That period brought horrors like ActiveX and the awful, unkillable IE6. Though, for the sake of fairness, it also brought us XmlHttpRequest which was the enabler of the AJAX revolution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Google's new technologies may end up being beneficial for web developers, but they also threaten to fragment the platform. After all, as the competition in the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/why_the_tablet_form_factor_is_winning\/\">\"post-PC\"<\/a> space heats up, the competitors are unlikely to embrace Google's extensions of the web stack.

We see more of this fragmentation every day. As a user of Chrome and Firefox (and Safari), I find it painful to experience, never mind the political bad taste.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Ok, counter-arguments. What's wrong with playing hardball to advance the web, you say? As my blog tries to explain, the standards process requires good social relations and philosophical balance among the participating competitors.<\/p>\n  \n  <p>Google's approach with Dart is thus pretty much all wrong and doomed to leave Dart in excellent yet non-standardized and non-interoperable implementation status. Dart is GBScript to NaCl\/Pepper's ActiveG.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I've been a long-time fan of many of Google's services, and have visited some of their offices a few times.

We started the work towards the next major version of it, codenamed <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/IKS\/zart.js\">Zart<\/a> (for Mozart) in a Salzburg IKS hackathon couple of weeks ago.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/VIE\/raw\/master\/vie_logo_100.png\" alt=\"VIE\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I merged the Zart codebase into the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/VIE\">VIE repository<\/a>. This blog post describes some of the improvements it brings.<\/p>\n\n<h2>VIE now has an instance<\/h2>\n\n<p>For VIE 1.x users the first visible change (and probably the only necessary API change) is that now VIE needs to be instantiated before being used. <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/scottdensmore\/archive\/2004\/05\/25\/140827.aspx\">Singletons are evil<\/a>, and so we are not a singleton any longer.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, for existing VIE code, you need to:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>var vie = new VIE();\n\/\/ and then any traditional VIE calls, like:\nvar entities = vie.RDFaEntities.getInstances('div.article');\nconsole.log(\"There are \" + entities.length + \" RDFa entities in your articles\");\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The VIE 1.0 API can be disabled by passing a setting when instantiating VIE:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>var vie = new VIE({classic: false});\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h2>Services and VIE<\/h2>\n\n<p>The other big change in VIE is that now the API has been built in a service-oriented manner. This means that for example reading and writing RDFa is just a service you can enable and disable at will.<\/p>\n\n<p>The benefit here is that we can easily add support for other formats and capabilities without having to touch VIE internals. Thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/manu.sporny.org\/2011\/false-choice\/\">schema.org situation<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/microdata\/\">Microdata<\/a> is getting more use, and so at some point we'll probably add a service for it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Registering and accessing services is easy:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>\/\/ Instantiate VIE\nvar vie = new VIE();\n\n\/\/ Pass the service instance and a name you want to use for it\nvie.use(new vie.RdfaService, 'rdfa');\n\n\/\/ Call a method from the service using the name\n\/\/ this one would give us the RDF subject of the\n\/\/ element matched by the jQuery selector\nvie.service('rdfa').getElementSubject('div.article');\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>An immediate benefit here is that we can have two RDFa parsing implementations. If you have problems with our own custom jQuery-based RDFa parser, then you can use the more strict <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/rdfquery\/\">rdfQuery<\/a> powered implementation instead:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>vie.use(new RdfaRdfQueryService, 'rdfa');\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h2>Using deferreds<\/h2>\n\n<p>For the new main VIE API we created a sort of a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Domain-specific_language\">Domain-Specific Language<\/a> for handling semantic entities. A core part of it is that now all operations utilize <a href=\"http:\/\/www.erichynds.com\/jquery\/using-deferreds-in-jquery\/\">jQuery's Deferred<\/a> objects. With them you can attach different callbacks to the results of your operation, and they will fire either when the operation completes, or immediately if the operation has already been run.<\/p>\n\n<p>This gives a lot of flexibility in using the API, and allows us to provide same API for services that deal with the DOM, and services that talk to external APIs like <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/stanbol\/\">Stanbol<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, parsing RDFa from a given DOM element (provided with a jQuery selector) happens like this:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>vie.load({\n        element: 'div.article'\n    }).\n    from('rdfa').\n    execute().\n    done(function(entities) {\n        console.log(entities);\n    });\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>The chain here is: <em>operation<\/em> (in this case, load), <em>from service<\/em> (rdfa), <em>execute<\/em> operation, then when <em>done<\/em>, do <em>callback<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the RDFa service we register Backbone Views for the elements our entities came from, so just like with VIE 1.x, they will update automatically when you change the contents of your entities. But manual writing is also available in case you need it. Here is how it works:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>vie.save({\n        element: 'div.article',\n        entity: someBackboneModel\n    }).\n    to('rdfa').\n    execute().\n    done(function() {\n        console.log(\"Saved!\");\n    });\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>In addition to <em>done<\/em>, which fires if the operation succeeds, you have <em>fail<\/em> for failed operations, and <em>then<\/em> which fires regardless of success or failure.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Accessing external services<\/h2>\n\n<p>The new VIE is not just about RDFa. In addition to working with the entities you have on a page, you can also access external repositories of semantic information, like <a href=\"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/About\">DBpedia<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, to find out everything that Wikipedia knows about Salzburg, you could run:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>vie.use(new vie.DBPediaService, 'dbpedia');\nvie.load({\n        entity: '&lt;http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salzburg&gt;'\n    }).\n    using('dbpedia').\n    execute().\n    done(function(entity) {\n        console.log(\"This is what we know of Salzburg\");\n        console.log(entity);\n    });\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>In browser usage these calls to external services are subject to cross-domain AJAX limitations. A way to work around those is to set up a proxy, and tell the DBpedia service to use that. To do this, pass the proxy URL to the service when instantiating:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>vie.use(new vie.DBPediaService({proxyUrl: 'http:\/\/localhost:8080'});\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>With this, all the factual information from Wikipedia will be at your disposal. The size of every city, the height of every mountain. Birthdates and places of birth for famous people. Your web app can do quite a bit with this information.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Finding entities from text<\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/stanbol\/\">Apache Stanbol<\/a> is a semantic engine that can extract all kinds of entities from text documents. It can be used for auto-tagging and other things.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is how you can use it with VIE:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>vie.use(new vie.StanbolService, 'stanbol');\nvie.analyze({\n        element: 'div.article'\n    }).\n    using('stanbol').\n    execute().\n    done(function(entities) {\n        console.log(\"We got the following enhancements for article content\");\n        console.log(entities);\n    });\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Stanbol can tell you what a piece of content talks about. People mentioned, places, concepts. It will also give you the language of the text.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Moving forward<\/h2>\n\n<p>The new version of VIE is still under heavy development. Most of the thngs work, but some details may still change. It is a good idea to start taking a look at it now, but before a beta release at least, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/VIE\/tree\/1.0.0\">VIE 1.0<\/a> is the recommended tool to use.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you already use VIE 1.0 for making your content editable, VIE 2.x will give you a lot of additional power. Enhancements, data queries, namespace handling, and much more.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/szabyg\">Szaby<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/neogermi\">Sebastian<\/a> for helping to make this happen!<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/business_analytics_with_couchdb_and_noflo\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Business analytics with CouchDB and NoFlo","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2011-09-21 17:52:53","atom:content":"<p>The purpose of <a href=\"http:\/\/37signals.com\/svn\/posts\/3002-the-three-secrets-of-business-analytics-no-rocket-science-here\">business analytics<\/a> is to find data from the company's information systems that can be used to support decision making. What customers buy most? What do they do before a buying decision? What are the signs that a customer may be leaving?<\/p>\n\n<p>For the last month we've been working in Salzburg to build such a system, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iks-project.eu\/resources\/intelligent-project-controlling-tool\">Intelligent Project Controlling Tool<\/a> needed for running large collaborative research projects like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iks-project.eu\/\">IKS<\/a>. Since the design we went with can be reused for other business analytics needs, I wanted to write a bit about it.<\/p>\n\n<p>But first, here is how our system looks like:<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-1e0e47ad96fbfcee47a11e08d46e7126c9836c236c2\/proggis-iks-projectplan-500.png\" alt=\"Proggis displaying IKS project plan\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Where does the data come from?<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are many ways to gather business data. Often the information systems already contain the data needed. But it may also be hidden in a jungle of spreadsheets. Or maybe some data is simply not available, and has to be filled in manually.<\/p>\n\n<p>Handling all these cases in one system is a tricky question. To solve it, we went with a two-layered strategy:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All data used for analytics is stored as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Linked_Data\">Linked Data<\/a> in a CouchDB system<\/li>\n<li>NoFlo workflows are used for gathering data from the diverse sources and convert it to the format needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In IKS's case, much of the data was available in a series of spreadsheets. With these, we built the necessary workflows for first converting the spreadsheets into XML with <a href=\"http:\/\/tika.apache.org\/\">Apache Tika<\/a>, and then extracting the information from them in a sensible subset of JSON-LD.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because IKS is a collaborative project, information needs to be gathered from a diverse group of partner organizations. Some of them have systems that provide the needed APIs (like <a href=\"http:\/\/basecamphq.com\/\">Basecamp<\/a>, which <a href=\"http:\/\/nemein.com\/en\/\">we<\/a> use), and we can just periodically import the data. But with many we decided on a simple data interchange approach: spreadsheets handled over email.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this approach, user files a data request into the system. This gets picked up by NoFlo, which sends an email with the appropriate spreadsheet template to the partner. Then it starts waiting for a reply. When a reply arrives, it extracts the data from the attached spreadsheet and imports it to the system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our NoFlo processes are mostly initiated by the <a href=\"http:\/\/guide.couchdb.org\/draft\/notifications.html\">CouchDB change notification API<\/a>. We keep them running persistently using <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.nodejitsu.com\/keep-a-nodejs-server-up-with-forever\">forever Node<\/a>, so whenever some operation needs to be run it happens nearly immediately.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Ensuring data consistency<\/h2>\n\n<p>With any automation, and especially with the email-based data interchange, things can go wrong. Because of this we tag all data that we receive with its origin, whether it was some automated operation or an imported spreadsheet. These origins are called <em>execution documents<\/em>. Users can browse all completed workflow executions and see what data came in from them. These can then be either accepted or rejected.<\/p>\n\n<p>This way if some partner accidentally sends faulty data, or something else breaks, the incorrect information received can be easily removed. CouchDB's versioning capabilities help here.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Analyzing the data<\/h2>\n\n<p>CouchDB is built on top of the concept of map\/reduce. Here you can modify and combine the data in lots of different ways using <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.apache.org\/couchdb\/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views\">simple JavaScript functions<\/a>. In our case we elected to write all our CouchDB code in CoffeeScript for simplicity. For example, here is the reduce function in CoffeeScript that counts totals of time planned, time used, and time left per task or partner in a project:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>(keys, values, rereduce) -&gt;\n    roundNumber = (rnum, rlength) -&gt;\n        Math.round(parseFloat(rnum) * Math.pow(10, rlength)) \/ Math.pow(10, rlength)\n    data =\n        planned: 0.0\n        spent: 0.0\n        left: 0.0\n\n    if rereduce\n        for reducedData in values\n            data.planned += reducedData.planned\n            data.spent += reducedData.spent\n        data.left = data.planned - data.spent\n        return data\n\n    for doc in values\n        if doc['@type'] is 'effortallocation'\n            data.planned += roundNumber doc.value, 1\n        if doc['@type'] is 'effort'\n            data.spent += roundNumber doc.value, 1\n    data.left = roundNumber data.planned - data.spent, 1\n    return data\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>If you figure out a new way to look at the data you have, simply write the needed map and reduce functions and save them into the database. CouchDB will then run them against existing data and produce numbers.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Data visualizations<\/h2>\n\n<p>Numbers are good, but to really see the information buried in them you need some visualizations. For this we decided to follow the <a href=\"http:\/\/couchapp.org\/page\/what-is-couchapp\">CouchApp<\/a> idea where the user interface code is stored in the database together with the data itself. This way no application servers are needed, and you can take the whole system with you just by <a href=\"http:\/\/guide.couchdb.org\/draft\/replication.html\">replicating the database<\/a>. Think of the possibility of doing some analysis on your company while flying to a meeting!<\/p>\n\n<p>The visuals are in our case provided by <a href=\"http:\/\/thejit.org\/\">JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit<\/a>, a nice, MIT-licensed interactive graph library.<\/p>\n\n<p>CouchDB views handle the number crunching, then CouchDB <a href=\"http:\/\/guide.couchdb.org\/draft\/transforming.html\">list functions<\/a> process the numbers into the format needed for visualization. This leaves only a minimal amount of work for the client side.<\/p>\n\n<p>For consistency <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/IKS\/Proggis\">our application<\/a> has been built with <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/andrzejsliwa\/coffeeapp\">CoffeeApp<\/a>, so all the database and user interface code is in <a href=\"http:\/\/jashkenas.github.com\/coffee-script\/\">CoffeeScript<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>In a nutshell<\/h2>\n\n<p>Any business analytics system dealing with moderate amounts of data can be built following this approach.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/couchdb.apache.org\/\">Apache CouchDB<\/a> is the central data store<\/li>\n<li>All data is stored as <a href=\"http:\/\/json-ld.org\/\">JSON-LD<\/a> entities<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/noflo#readme\">NoFlo<\/a> handles all data imports<\/li>\n<li>Analytics based on the data are done with CouchDB map\/reduce<\/li>\n<li>Visualization happens with a CouchApp using <a href=\"http:\/\/thejit.org\/\">JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"\/midcom-serveattachmentguid-1e0e47b247c04d2e47b11e08d46e7126c9836c236c2\/proggis-architecture.png\" alt=\"Simple architecture for a business analytics system\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>This way you have a business analytics environment that is easy to extend with more data when it becomes available. New analysis can be done by writing reasonably simple map\/reduce functions, and CouchDB's replication capabilities allow you to take the system and data with you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using JSON-LD for the data storage makes a lot of sense, as this way the relations between different pieces of information are easy to handle. And using URIs for data identifiers means you can easily mash up information coming from different sources together.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two-layered approach of using NoFlo for data imports, and CouchDB for analysis also allows for clean separation of concerns. In our case, I did the workflow part of things, and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/szabyg\">Szaby<\/a> built the visualizations.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/where_is_the_future_for_openness_in_mobile\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Where is the future for openness in mobile?","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2011-10-03 17:53:42","atom:content":"<p>These are tough times for fans of open mobile environments.

Based on conversations I've had in various conferences, I'm by far not alone in this situation - using Node.js for real-time functionality, and PHP (or Django, or Rails) for the more traditional CRUD stuff.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both environments have their strong points. Node.js is very fast and flexible, but PHP has a lot more mature tools and libraries available. So in a lot of projects it is hard to choose between the two. But now you might not have to.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Enter DNode<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/substack.net\/posts\/85e1bd\/DNode-Asynchronous-Remote-Method-Invocation-for-Node-js-and-the-Browser\">DNode<\/a> is a <em>remote method invocation<\/em> protocol originally written for Node.js, as the name probably tells.

The implementation isn't yet complete, but works already quite well.<\/p>\n\n<p>With DNode you can expose Node.js functions to be available on PHP, and PHP class methods to be available on Node.<\/p>\n\n<p>Like most Node.js functionality, DNode works asynchronously. So instead of waiting for return values you supply a callback function that will be called when the method completes.<\/p>\n\n<h2>PHP as client<\/h2>\n\n<p>Here is a simple DNode service for Node.js:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>var dnode = require('dnode');\nvar server = dnode({\n    zing: function (n, cb) { cb(n * 100) }\n});\nserver.listen(7070);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>This creates a DNode service running in TCP port 7070 that provides one method: <em>zing<\/em> that multiplies the value given to it by 100 and sends the result to the callback provided.<\/p>\n\n<p>Calling this with PHP is easy:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>\/\/ Connect to DNode server running in port 7070 and call \n\/\/ Zing with argument 33\n$dnode = new DNode\\DNode();\n$dnode-&gt;connect(7070, function($remote, $connection) {\n    \/\/ Remote is a proxy object that provides us all methods\n    \/\/ from the server\n    $remote-&gt;zing(33, function($n) use ($connection) {\n        echo \"n = {$n}\\n\";\n        \/\/ Once we have the result we can close the connection\n        $connection-&gt;end();\n    });\n});\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Now just start the server:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ node simple\/server.js\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>And run the client. As you can see from the PHP code above, once we get the result the client will end the connection automatically:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ php examples\/simple\/client.php \nn = 3300\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Because only simple TCP connections and JSON packets are used, this is quite fast.

All public methods of the object will be made available to the DNode clients:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>\/\/ This is the class we're exposing to DNode\nclass Zinger\n{\n    \/\/ Public methods are made available to the network\n    public function zing($n, $cb)\n    {\n        \/\/ Dnode is async, so we return via callback\n        $cb($n * 100);\n    }\n}\n\n\/\/ Create a DNode server\n$server = new DNode\\DNode(new Zinger());\n$server-&gt;listen(7070);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>This DNode service will obviously be visible for both Node.js and PHP clients.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Bidirectional communications<\/h2>\n\n<p>A DNode client can also expose methods to the server.

Because depending on code from others as been tricky, every major PHP application or framework has practically had to reimplement the whole world. Only some tools, like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sebastianbergmann\/phpunit\/\">PHPUnit<\/a>, have managed to break over this barrier and become de-facto standards across project boundaries. But for the rest: just write it yourself.<\/p>\n\n<p>But now <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/about-composer\">Composer<\/a>, and its repository counterpart <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/\">Packagist<\/a>, promise to change all that. And obviously new conventions like PHP's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/language.namespaces.rationale.php\">namespacing support<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/php-fig\/fig-standards\/blob\/master\/accepted\/PSR-0.md\">PSR-0<\/a> standard autoloader help.<\/p>\n\n<p>Composer is heavily inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/npmjs.org\/\">NPM<\/a> which has built a strong culture of code-sharing and easy deployment in the Node.js community.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Easy for users<\/h2>\n\n<p>With Composer, managing dependencies in your project is very easy. Simply create a <code>composer.json<\/code> file where you state your dependencies, and let the package management system worry about the rest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Packages that are registered with packagist.org are obviously easiest to depend on, but you can also state packages coming from custom repositories (like your company's internal version control system), or PHP extensions that you need.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is for example the <code>composer.json<\/code> from the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/phpcr-midgard2\">Midgard PHPCR provider<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"name\": \"midgard\/phpcr\",\n    \"type\": \"library\",\n    \"require\": {\n        \"php\": \"&gt;=5.3.0\",\n        \"ext-midgard2\": \"&gt;=10.05.5\",\n        \"phpcr\/phpcr\": \"&gt;=2.1.0-beta1\"\n    }\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>With this file, Composer knows that our PHPCR provider runs only on PHP 5.3 or newer (as it uses namespaces), and that it needs the <a href=\"http:\/\/new.midgard-project.org\/midgard2\/\">Midgard PHP extension<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/phpcr.github.com\/\">PHPCR interface classes<\/a> to be available.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now installing the project is easy:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ wget http:\/\/getcomposer.org\/composer.phar \n$ php composer.phar install\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>How about autoloading? Traditionally PHP required you to manually <code>include<\/code> or <code>require<\/code> all files you wanted to use in your code, with the possibility to <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.autoload.php\">write an autoloader<\/a> to handle it automatically when you call an undefined class. But managing these autoloaders is also a chore.<\/p>\n\n<p>Composer helps here too, by automatically generating an autoloader that will be able to load your own code, and the code from all your dependencies. So you can get rid of your own autoloaders and <code>include<\/code> statements, and just include the Composer-generated autoloader in your code:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>require 'vendor\/.composer\/autoload.php';\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>After this all the classes you've stated your application needing will be available.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Easy for developers<\/h2>\n\n<p>While ease-of-installation is important, it isn't enough to build an ecosystem. The other thing that has to be easy is publishing code. Basically: <em>if you've written a piece of functionality in PHP that you could see yourself using in another project, it should be effortless to publish it as a library.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>This is where approaches like PEAR mostly failed, by making it too cumbersome to define your packages, to build them, and to upload them to the repository.<\/p>\n\n<p>With Composer <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/about\">this is very easy<\/a>. You again define a <code>composer.json<\/code> for your package, and push that to your project's Git repository. Then just <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/packages\/submit\">register<\/a> the Git repository URL with packagist.org.<\/p>\n\n<p>After this Packagist will spider your repository and make it available as a package.<\/p>\n\n<p>Publishing new versions is very easy: simply keep your <code>composer.json<\/code> up-to-date, and <a href=\"http:\/\/learn.github.com\/p\/tagging.html\">tag your releases<\/a> in Git.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Where are we now?<\/h2>\n\n<p>It is still early days for Composer, and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/composer\/composer\">the project<\/a> is being worked on at a hectic pace. However, it is already good enough for managing dependencies to modern, PSR-0 compatible libraries.<\/p>\n\n<p>What I would like to see happen next is support for custom package roles and autoloaders. This would allow us to handle more specific cases, like for example installation of <a href=\"http:\/\/new.midgard-project.org\/midgardmvc\/#structure_of_a_component\">Midgard MVC components<\/a> and their non-namespaced autoloading needs. After that we should be able to get rid of our custom installer code and just join the Composer crowd.<\/p>\n\n<p>But if your code is already fully namespaced, this is a great time to get started with <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/about-composer\">Composer<\/a>.<\/p>\n"},{"#":{"dc":"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/","atom":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/Atom"},"@":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/call_for_presentations-open_mobile_linux_at_fosdem_2012\/>","a":"atom:entry","dc:title":"Call for presentations: Open Mobile Linux at FOSDEM 2012","dc:creator":"<http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/#me>","dc:date":"2011-12-14 09:46:57","atom:content":"<p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/fosdem.org\/2012\/\">FOSDEM 2012<\/a> we will have a <a href=\"http:\/\/fosdem.org\/2012\/devrooms_for_2012\">devroom<\/a> related to <em>Open Mobile Linux<\/em>.

By splitting the CMS to the separate concepts of user interface, web framework, and content repository we can provide implementers a greater degree of freedom, and allow CMS developers to focus on the functionality where they can best make a difference.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is Create?<\/h2>\n\n<p>With CreateJS, content management system developers can provide a simple, fast, and modern editing interface to their end-users. The UI is completely built in JavaScript, and can be integrated with three easy steps:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Mark up your pages with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xhtml-rdfa-primer\/#id84624\">RDFa annotations<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Include <a href=\"http:\/\/viejs.org\/\">VIE<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/createjs.org\/\">Create<\/a> into the pages<\/li>\n<li>Implement <a href=\"http:\/\/documentcloud.github.com\/backbone\/#Sync\">Backbone.sync<\/a> with your CMS back-end<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Create provides functionality like in-page content editing, managing of content collections (like article lists), running workflows for content, and handling images and content tagging. The jQuery UI plugin -based structure allows CMS developers also to implement their own additional functionality. This also makes it possible to either use the whole Create UI as-is, or just to take the parts of it that fit the UX concept of a system.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/introducing_the_midgard_create_user_interface\/\">Create UI<\/a> was initially made for <a href=\"http:\/\/new.midgard-project.org\/\">Midgard CMS<\/a>, but has since been generalized so that it works anywhere. This approach has already <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bergie\/status\/146885794940993536\">gained some popularity<\/a>, with CreateJS widgets being used in projects like <a href=\"http:\/\/cmf.symfony.com\/\">Symfony CMF<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/sandbox\/dominikb1888\/1388900\">Drupal<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.iks-project.eu\/viegwt-hackathon-at-alkacon\/\">OpenCMS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The January hackathon<\/h2>\n\n<p>To push CreateJS forward we organized <a href=\"http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2012\/createjs-hackathon\/\">a hackathon in Zurich, Switzerland<\/a> in the early January. Participants came from different <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iks-project.eu\/community\/partners\">IKS project partners<\/a> and CreateJS early adopters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the results were:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/create\/blob\/master\/src\/jquery.Midgard.midgardWorkflows.js\">Workflow support<\/a>, allowing CMSs to define per-content actions like publish\/unpublish<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/create\/blob\/master\/src\/jquery.Midgard.midgardNotifications.js\">UI notifications<\/a>, including the possibility to build scripted tutorials for site editors<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/createMarkdown\">WYSIWYG editing of Markdown documents<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Much more flexible <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/create\/blob\/master\/src\/jquery.Midgard.midgardEditable.js#L9\">handling of editing widgets<\/a>, for example to choose whether some content should be edited with a rich text editor, or a date picker<\/li>\n<li>Smart <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/hallo\/blob\/master\/plugins\/image.coffee\">image insertion<\/a> when using the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.github.com\/hallo\/\">Hallo editor<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/create\/pull\/37\">Content tagging<\/a> support<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/blogsiple\">Blogsiple<\/a>, a CreateJS CMS integration testbed written for Node.js<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Image insertion, link management, and content tagging have been designed to work together so that they can find about annotated entities thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/incubator.apache.org\/stanbol\/\">Apache Stanbol<\/a> engine and provide intelligent suggestions on related content.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Moving forward<\/h2>\n\n<p>The important next step is to consolidate all these changes into the CreateJS codebase and to ensure that everything works smoothly together. Our <a href=\"http:\/\/travis-ci.org\/bergie\/create\">continuous integration setup<\/a> would also benefit from a larger number of tests.<\/p>\n\n<p>After that we can consider new features, including things <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/create\/issues\">currently under discussion<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Helping CMSs to integrate this common user interface (or parts of it) is also a major task for this year.

After that we'll  have a hackathon in Saarbrucken, Germany where the plan is to focus on  things that we've targeted for a 2.1.<\/p>\n<p>The main feature of VIE 2.1 is a new way of handling RDF literals. This will make it easier to interface with services like <a href=\"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/About\">DBpedia<\/a> that give us data in multiple different languages. This will enable you to do things like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>var eiffel = vie.entities.get('dbp:Eiffel_Tower');\nconsole.log(eiffel.get('label')); \/\/ Eiffel Tower\n\nvie.setLanguage('fi');\nconsole.log(eiffel.get('label')); \/\/ Eiffel-torni\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The final API for this is <a href=\"https:\/\/groups.google.com\/d\/topic\/viejs\/bXK3Xg-rrLA\/discussion\">still being discussed<\/a> on the VIE mailing list.<\/p>\n<h2>Create and Hallo are now easier to integrate<\/h2>\n<p>Both Create and <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.github.com\/hallo\">Hallo<\/a>,  our minimalist rich text editing tool now provide merged JavaScript  files for easier integration. You can find the merged files, and also  minified versions in:<\/p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/hallo\/blob\/master\/examples\/hallo.js\">hallo.js<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/create\/blob\/master\/examples\/create.js\">create.js<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Thanks to contributions from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alkacon.com\/en\/\">Alkacon<\/a>,  Create's widget selection mechanism is now much more configurable. This  allows CMS developers to provide different editing tools for different  types of information.<\/p>\n<p>The currently bundled editing interfaces provide integration with Hallo, and also with the 0.20 version of <a href=\"http:\/\/aloha-editor.org\/\">Aloha Editor<\/a> (though you will need to install Aloha separately to use it due to licensing restrictions).<\/p>\n<p>CMS developers will also benefit from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/blogsiple\">Blogsiple<\/a>,  the new integration testbed for Create and VIE. Blogsiple aims to be a  very simple blog system built on top of Node.js that shows all the  necessary integration points for supporting the whole range of VIE and  Create features.<\/p>\n<h2>CMS adoption<\/h2>\n<p>As both VIE and Create improve, so does their adoption in different Content Management Systems.

It could even be recommended to those who aren't necessarily interested in contributing, but are curious about what this \"free software thing\" is all about. It is, in short, a great book for a variety of audiences and the (mostly) two or three page essays make it easy to read, while the anecdotes and recollections personalize it. The authors, editor, and everyone else who helped should be very pleased with the result. Readers will be too.<\/blockquote>\n<p>I probably shouldn't give the ending away, but my essay on cross-project collaboration, a subject I've <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/on_cross-project_collaboration\/\">also blogged about<\/a>, ends with:<\/p>\n<blockquote>Good luck with breaking down the project boundaries! In most cases it works if your ideas are good and presented with an open mind.

If your application code is already managed in Git, in most cases you only need to create a Heroku app setup, and then <code>git push<\/code> to deploy it on Heroku. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heroku.com\/how\/scale\">Scaling your app<\/a> is easy and there are many <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.heroku.com\/\">useful add-ons<\/a> available in their \"app store\".<\/p>\n\n<p>While Heroku <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flourish.org\/blog\/?p=687\">got its start<\/a> from hosting Ruby on Rails applications, it nowadays supports <a href=\"https:\/\/devcenter.heroku.com\/articles\/cedar\">many different environments<\/a> in the Cedar stack. Node.js is what many use, but they also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gravitywell.co.uk\/blog\/post\/deploying-php-apps-to-heroku\">do support PHP<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dependency management is easy for Node.js applications as Heroku recognizes your <code>package.json<\/code> files and <a href=\"https:\/\/devcenter.heroku.com\/articles\/nodejs#declare_dependencies_with_npm\">automatically installs<\/a> the libraries needed via <a href=\"http:\/\/search.npmjs.org\/\">NPM<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Until now PHP developers haven't had this convenience, but as <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/\">Composer<\/a> is emerging as the <a href=\"http:\/\/bergie.iki.fi\/blog\/composer_solves_the_php_code-sharing_problem\/\">default PHP package manager<\/a>, I've now <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/heroku\/heroku-buildpack-php\/pull\/10\">added support<\/a> for it. Before the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/heroku\/heroku-buildpack-php\/pull\/10\">pull request<\/a> gets accepted, Composer dependency handling can already be used by specifying <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/heroku-buildpack-php\">my custom PHP buildpack<\/a> when creating Heroku apps.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've written <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/urlizer_service\">a simple example app<\/a> to show how this works.<\/p>\n\n<p>First you need to create the folder for your app and make it a Git repository:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ mkdir myapp\n$ cd myapp\n$ git init\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Then create the Heroku app using a custom buildpack (when the pull request is accepted you can skip the buildpack definition):<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ heroku create -s cedar --buildpack https:\/\/github.com\/bergie\/heroku-buildpack-php.git my-cool-app\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Then it is time to write your <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/\">composer.json<\/a> file. In this case we'll only depend on the <a href=\"http:\/\/packagist.org\/packages\/midgard\/midgardmvc-helper-urlize\">urlize library<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"php\": \"&gt;=5.2.0\",\n        \"midgard\/midgardmvc-helper-urlize\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>For Heroku to recognize the app as a PHP one, you also need to have an <code>index.php<\/code>. In this case with the following code:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\/\/ URLizer service\nrequire 'vendor\/midgard\/midgardmvc-helper-urlize\/interface.php';\nif (isset($_GET['urlize'])) {\n    $data = array();\n    $data['from'] = $_GET['urlize'];\n    $data['to'] = midgardmvc_helper_urlize::string($_GET['urlize']);\n    header('Content-type: application\/json; charset=utf-8');\n    die(json_encode($data));\n}\nheader('Content-Type: text\/html; charset=utf-8');\n?&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Urlizer service&lt;\/h1&gt;\n&lt;form method=\"GET\"&gt;\n    &lt;label&gt;\n        String to URLize\n        &lt;input name=\"urlize\" type=\"text\" \/&gt;\n    &lt;\/label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"URLize\" \/&gt;\n&lt;\/form&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Now add and commit these files, and then deploy to Heroku:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git push heroku master\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>You should see that Heroku notices the Composer dependencies and installs them:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>-----&gt; Heroku receiving push\n-----&gt; Fetching custom buildpack... done\n-----&gt; PHP app detected\n-----&gt; Bundling Apache version 2.2.22\n-----&gt; Bundling PHP version 5.3.10\n-----&gt; Installing Composer dependencies\nInstalling dependencies\n  - Package phptal\/phptal (dev-master)\n    Cloning e146361f25b8672d364695b757eddf1c169e05d2\n\n  - Package midgard\/midgardmvc-core (dev-master)\n    Cloning 2b00d38cb2fea42c8f9791c5ecc7270dc81182e8\n\n  - Package midgard\/midgardmvc-helper-urlize (dev-master)\n    Cloning 92d0c8c638c389b7be1887ca67cd334f51932912\n\nmidgard\/midgardmvc-core suggests installing ext-midgard2 (&gt;=10.05.5)\nWriting lock file\nGenerating autoload files\n-----&gt; Discovering process types\n       Procfile declares types -&gt; (none)\n       Default types for PHP   -&gt; web\n-----&gt; Compiled slug size is 13.2MB\n-----&gt; Launching... done, v13\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>And that is it!
